Development Tips
================

**Note:** Unless otherwise stated, directory and file paths are relative to the
project root directory.

Compilation
-----------

To speed up compilation, be sure to install Ray with the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

 cd python
 pip install -e . --verbose

The ``-e`` means "editable", so changes you make to files in the Ray
directory will take effect without reinstalling the package. In contrast, if
you do ``python setup.py install``, files will be copied from the Ray
directory to a directory of Python packages (often something like
``$HOME/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray``). This means that
changes you make to files in the Ray directory will not have any effect.

If you run into **Permission Denied** errors when running ``pip install``,
you can try adding ``--user``. You may also need to run something like ``sudo
chown -R $USER $HOME/anaconda3`` (substituting in the appropriate path).

If you make changes to the C++ or Python files, you will need to run the 
build so C++ code is recompiled and/or Python files are redeployed in 
the ``python`` directory. However, you do not need to rerun 
``pip install -e .``. Instead, you can recompile much more quickly by running
the following:

.. code-block:: shell

 bash build.sh

This command is not enough to recompile all C++ unit tests. To do so, see
`Testing locally`_.

Debugging
---------

Starting processes in a debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When processes are crashing, it is often useful to start them in a debugger.
Ray currently allows processes to be started in the following:

- valgrind
- the valgrind profiler
- the perftools profiler
- gdb
- tmux

To use any of these tools, please make sure that you have them installed on
your machine first (``gdb`` and ``valgrind`` on MacOS are known to have issues).
Then, you can launch a subset of ray processes by adding the environment
variable ``RAY_{PROCESS_NAME}_{DEBUGGER}=1``. For instance, if you wanted to
start the raylet in ``valgrind``, then you simply need to set the environment
variable ``RAY_RAYLET_VALGRIND=1``.

To start a process inside of ``gdb``, the process must also be started inside of
``tmux``. So if you want to start the raylet in ``gdb``, you would start your
Python script with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

 RAY_RAYLET_GDB=1 RAY_RAYLET_TMUX=1 python

You can then list the ``tmux`` sessions with ``tmux ls`` and attach to the
appropriate one.

You can also get a core dump of the ``raylet`` process, which is especially
useful when filing `issues`_. The process to obtain a core dump is OS-specific,
but usually involves running ``ulimit -c unlimited`` before starting Ray to
allow core dump files to be written.

Inspecting Redis shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To inspect Redis, you can use the global state API. The easiest way to do this
is to start or connect to a Ray cluster with ``ray.init()``, then query the API
like so:

.. code-block:: python

 ray.init()
 ray.nodes()
 # Returns current information about the nodes in the cluster, such as:
 # [{'ClientID': '2a9d2b34ad24a37ed54e4fcd32bf19f915742f5b',
 #   'IsInsertion': True,
 #   'NodeManagerAddress': '1.2.3.4',
 #   'NodeManagerPort': 43280,
 #   'ObjectManagerPort': 38062,
 #   'ObjectStoreSocketName': '/tmp/ray/session_2019-01-21_16-28-05_4216/sockets/plasma_store',
 #   'RayletSocketName': '/tmp/ray/session_2019-01-21_16-28-05_4216/sockets/raylet',
 #   'Resources': {'CPU': 8.0, 'GPU': 1.0}}]

To inspect the primary Redis shard manually, you can also query with commands
like the following.

.. code-block:: python

 r_primary = ray.worker.global_worker.redis_client
 r_primary.keys("*")

To inspect other Redis shards, you will need to create a new Redis client.
For example (assuming the relevant IP address is ``127.0.0.1`` and the
relevant port is ``1234``), you can do this as follows.

.. code-block:: python

 import redis
 r = redis.StrictRedis(host='127.0.0.1', port=1234)

You can find a list of the relevant IP addresses and ports by running

.. code-block:: python

 r_primary.lrange('RedisShards', 0, -1)

.. _backend-logging:

Backend logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``raylet`` process logs detailed information about events like task
execution and object transfers between nodes. To set the logging level at
runtime, you can set the ``RAY_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL`` environment variable before
starting Ray. For example, you can do:

.. code-block:: shell

 export RAY_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL=debug
 ray start

This will print any ``RAY_LOG(DEBUG)`` lines in the source code to the
``raylet.err`` file, which you can find in the `Temporary Files`_.

Testing locally
---------------

Testing for Python development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose that one of the tests in a file of tests, e.g., 
``python/ray/tests/test_basic.py``, is failing. You can run just that
test file locally as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

 python -m pytest -v python/ray/tests/test_basic.py

However, this will run all of the tests in the file, which can take some
time. To run a specific test that is failing, you can do the following
instead:

.. code-block:: shell

 python -m pytest -v python/ray/tests/test_basic.py::test_keyword_args

When running tests, usually only the first test failure matters. A single
test failure often triggers the failure of subsequent tests in the same
file.

Testing for C++ development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile and run all C++ tests, you can run:

.. code-block:: shell

 bazel test $(bazel query 'kind(cc_test, ...)')

Alternatively, you can also run one specific C++ test. You can use:

.. code-block:: shell

 bazel test $(bazel query 'kind(cc_test, ...)') --test_filter=ClientConnectionTest --test_output=streamed


Building the Docs
-----------------

If you make changes that require documentation changes, don't forget to 
update the documentation!

When you make documentation changes, build them locally to verify they render
correctly. `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ is used to generate the documentation.

.. code-block:: shell

 cd doc
 pip install -r requirements-doc.txt 
 make html

Once done, the docs will be in ``doc/_build/html``. For example, on Mac 
OSX, you can open the docs (assuming you are still in the ``doc`` 
directory) using ``open _build/html/index.html``.
 

Creating a pull request
-----------------------

To create a pull request (PR) for your change, first go through the
`PR template`_ checklist and ensure you've completed all the steps.

When you push changes to GitHub, the formatting and verification script 
``ci/travis/format.sh`` is run first. For pushing to your fork, you can
skip this step with ``git push --no-verify``.

Before submitting the PR, you should run this script. If it fails, the
push operation will not proceed. This script requires *specific versions*
of the following tools. Installation commands are shown for convenience:

* `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ version ``0.23.0`` (``pip install yapf==0.23.0``)
* `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ version ``3.7.7`` (``pip install flake8==3.7.7``)
* `flake8-quotes <https://github.com/zheller/flake8-quotes>`_ (``pip install flake8-quotes``)
* `clang-format <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/clang-format.html>`_ version ``7.0.0`` (download this version of Clang from `here <http://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_)

**Note:** On MacOS X, don't use HomeBrew to install ``clang-format``, as the only version available is too new.

The Ray project automatically runs continuous integration (CI) tests once a PR
is opened using `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.com/ray-project/ray/>`_ with 
multiple CI test jobs.


Understand CI test jobs
-----------------------

The `Travis CI`_ test folder contains all integration test scripts and they
invoke other test scripts via ``pytest``, ``bazel``-based test or other bash
scripts. Some of the examples include:

* Raylet integration tests commands:
    * ``src/ray/test/run_core_worker_tests.sh``
    * ``src/ray/test/run_object_manager_tests.sh``

* Bazel test command:
    * ``bazel test --build_tests_only //:all``

* Ray serving test commands:
    * ``python -m pytest python/ray/serve/tests``
    * ``python python/ray/serve/examples/echo_full.py``

If a Travis-CI build exception doesn't appear to be related to your change,
please visit `this link <https://ray-travis-tracker.herokuapp.com/>`_ to 
check recent tests known to be flaky.


Format and Linting
------------------

Installation instructions for the tools mentioned here are discussed above in
`Creating a pull request`_.

**Running the linter locally:** To run the Python linter on a specific file, run
``flake8`` as in this example, ``flake8 python/ray/worker.py``. 

**Autoformatting code**. We use `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ for
linting. The config file is ``.style.yapf``. We recommend running
``scripts/yapf.sh`` prior to pushing a PR to format any changed files. Note 
that some projects, such as dataframes and rllib, are currently excluded.

**Running CI linter:** The Travis CI linter script has multiple components to
run. We recommend running ``ci/travis/format.sh``, which runs both linters for
Python and C++ codes. In addition, there are other formatting checkers for
components like the following:

* Python REAME format:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd python
    python setup.py check --restructuredtext --strict --metadata

* Bazel format:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./ci/travis/bazel-format.sh
