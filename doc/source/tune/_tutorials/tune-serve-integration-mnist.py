Model selection and serving with Ray Tune and Ray Serve
=======================================================
This tutorial will show you an end-to-end example how to train a
model using Ray Tune on incrementally arriving data and deploy
the model using Ray Serve.

A machine learning workflow can be quite simple: You decide on
the objective you're trying to solve, collect and annotate the
data, and build a model to hopefully solve your problem. But
usually the work is not over yet. First, you would likely continue
to do some hyperparameter optimization to obtain the best possible
model (called *model selection*). Second, your trained model
somehow has to be moved to production - in other words, users
or services should be enabled to use your model to actually make
predictions. This part is called *model serving*.

Fortunately, Ray includes two libraries that help you with these
two steps: Ray Tune and Ray Serve. And even more, they compliment
each other nicely. Most notably, both are able to scale up your
workloads easily - so both your model training and serving benefit
from additional resources and can adapt to your environment. If you
need to train on more data or have more hyperparameters to tune,
Ray Tune can leverage your whole cluster for training. If you have
many users doing inference on your served models, Ray Serve can
automatically distribute the inference backends to multiple nodes.

This tutorial will show you an end-to-end example how to train a MNIST
image classifier on incrementally arriving data and automatically
serve an updated model on a HTTP endpoint.

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to

1. Do hyperparameter optimization on a simple MNIST classifier
2. Continue to train this classifier from an existing model with
   newly arriving data
3. Automatically create and serve data backends with Ray Serve

Roadmap and desired functionality
---------------------------------
The general idea of this example is that we simulate newly arriving
data each day. So at day 0 we might have some initial data available
already, but at each day, new data arrives.

Our approach here is that we offer two ways to train: From scratch and
from an existing model. Maybe you would like to train and select models
from scratch each week with all data available until then, e.g. each
Sunday, like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Train with all data available at day 0
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_scratch --day 0

During the other days you might want to improve your model, but
not train everything from scratch, saving some cluster resources.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Train with data arriving between day 0 and day 1
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 1
    # Train with incremental data on the other days, too
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 2
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 3
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 4
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 5
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 6
    # Retrain from scratch every 7th day:
    python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_scratch --day 7

This example will support both modes. After each model selection run,
we will tell Ray Serve to serve an updated model. We also include a
small utility to query our served model to see if it works as it should.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --query 6
    Querying model with example #6. Label = 1, Response = 1, Correct = True

Imports
-------
Let's start with our dependencies. Most of these should be familiar
if you worked with PyTorch before. The most notable import for Ray
is the ``from ray import tune, serve`` import statement - which
includes almost all the things we need from the Ray side.

# 2. Continue training from existing model with new data only
# 3. Query the model with test data
#
# Internally, this will just call the ``tune_from_scratch`` and
# ``tune_from_existing()`` functions.
# Both training functions will then call ``serve_new_model()`` to serve
# the newly trained or updated model.

# The query function will send a HTTP request to Serve with some
# test data obtained from the MNIST dataset.

    This script offers training a new model from scratch with all
    available data, or continuing to train an existing model
    with newly available data.

    For instance, we might get new data every day. Every Sunday, we
    would like to train a new model from scratch.

    Naturally, we would like to use hyperparameter optimization to
    find the best model for out data.

    First, we might train a model with all data available at this day:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_scratch --day 0

    On the coming days, we want to continue to train this model with
    newly available data:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 1
        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 2
        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 3
        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 4
        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_existing --day 5

        # Retrain from scratch every 7th day:
        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --from_scratch --day 7

    We can also use this script to query our served model
    with some test data:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python tune-serve-integration-mnist.py --query 6
        Querying model with example #6. Label = 1, Response = 1, Correct = T

# That's it! We now have an end-to-end workflow to train and update a
# model every day with newly arrived data. Every week we might retrain
# the whole model. At every point in time we make sure to serve the
# model that achieved the best validation set accuracy.
#
# There are some ways we might extend this example. For instance, right
# now we only serve the latest trained model. We could  also choose to
# route only a certain percentage of users to the new model, maybe to
# see if the new model really does it's job right. These kind of
# deployments are called :ref:`canary deployments <serve-split-traffic>`.
# These kind of deployments would also require us to keep more than one
# model in our ``model_dir`` - which should be quite easy: We could just
# create subdirectories for each training day.
#
# Still, this example should show you how easy it is to integrate the
# Ray libraries Ray Tune and Ray Serve in your workflow. While both tools
# also work independently of each other, they complement each other
# nicely and support a large number of use cases.
