Tune Guides and Tutorials
=========================


Tune takes a user-defined Python function or class and evaluates it on a set of hyperparameter configurations.

Each hyperparameter configuration evaluation is called a *trial*, and multiple trials are run in parallel. Configurations are either generated by Tune or drawn from a user-specified **search algorithm**. The trials are scheduled and managed by a **trial scheduler**.
