Tune Trial Schedulers (tune.schedulers)
=======================================

In Tune, some hyperparameter optimization algorithms are written as "scheduling algorithms".
These Trial Schedulers can early terminate bad trials, pause trials, clone trials,
and alter hyperparameters of a running trial.

All Trial Schedulers take in a ``metric``, which is a value returned in the result dict of your
Trainable and is maximized or minimized according to ``mode``.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from ray.air import session
    from tune.schedulers import ASHAScheduler

    def train_fn(config):
        # This objective function is just for demonstration purposes
        session.report({"loss": config["param"]})

    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        train_fn,
        tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(
            scheduler=ASHAScheduler(),
            metric="loss",
            mode="min",
            num_samples=10,
        ),
        param_space={"param": tune.uniform(0, 1)},
    )
    results = tuner.fit()

.. currentmodule:: ray.tune.schedulers

.. _tune-scheduler-hyperband:

ASHA (tune.schedulers.ASHAScheduler)
------------------------------------

The `ASHA <https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Y7OOlRZ>`__ scheduler can be used by
setting the ``scheduler`` parameter of ``tune.TuneConfig``, which is taken in by ``Tuner``, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from tune.schedulers import ASHAScheduler

    asha_scheduler = ASHAScheduler(
        time_attr='training_iteration',
        metric='loss',
        mode='min',
        max_t=100,
        grace_period=10,
        reduction_factor=3,
        brackets=1,
    )
    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        train_fn,
        tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(scheduler=asha_scheduler),
    )
    results = tuner.fit()

Compared to the original version of HyperBand, this implementation provides better
parallelism and avoids straggler issues during eliminations.
**We recommend using this over the standard HyperBand scheduler.**
An example of this can be found here: :doc:`/tune/examples/includes/async_hyperband_example`.

Even though the original paper mentions a bracket count of 3, discussions with the authors concluded
that the value should be left to 1 bracket.
This is the default used if no value is provided for the ``brackets`` argument.

HyperBand Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementation details may deviate slightly from theory but are focused on increasing usability.
Note: ``R``, ``s_max``, and ``eta`` are parameters of HyperBand given by the paper.
See `this post <https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2018/12/12/massively-parallel-hyperparameter-optimization/>`_ for context.

1. Both ``s_max`` (representing the ``number of brackets - 1``) and ``eta``, representing the downsampling rate, are fixed.
    In many practical settings, ``R``, which represents some resource unit and often the number of training iterations,
    can be set reasonably large, like ``R >= 200``.
    For simplicity, assume ``eta = 3``. Varying ``R`` between ``R = 200`` and ``R = 1000``
    creates a huge range of the number of trials needed to fill up all brackets.

.. image:: /images/hyperband_bracket.png

On the other hand, holding ``R`` constant at ``R = 300`` and varying ``eta`` also leads to
HyperBand configurations that are not very intuitive:

.. image:: /images/hyperband_eta.png

The implementation takes the same configuration as the example given in the paper
and exposes ``max_t``, which is not a parameter in the paper.

2. The example in the `post <https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2018/12/12/massively-parallel-hyperparameter-optimization/>`_ to calculate ``n_0``
    is actually a little different than the algorithm given in the paper.
    In this implementation, we implement ``n_0`` according to the paper (which is `n` in the below example):

.. image:: /images/hyperband_allocation.png


3. There are also implementation specific details like how trials are placed into brackets which are not covered in the paper.
    This implementation places trials within brackets according to smaller bracket first - meaning
    that with low number of trials, there will be less early stopping.

.. _tune-scheduler-msr:

Median Stopping Rule (tune.schedulers.MedianStoppingRule)
---------------------------------------------------------

The Median Stopping Rule implements the simple strategy of stopping a trial if its performance falls
below the median of other trials at similar points in time.

.. _tune-scheduler-pbt:

Population Based Training (tune.schedulers.PopulationBasedTraining)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tune includes a distributed implementation of `Population Based Training (PBT) <https://www.deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-of-neural-networks>`__.
This can be enabled by setting the ``scheduler`` parameter of ``tune.TuneConfig``, which is taken in by ``Tuner``, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from ray.tune.schedulers import PopulationBasedTraining

    pbt_scheduler = PopulationBasedTraining(
        time_attr='training_iteration',
        metric='loss',
        mode='min',
        perturbation_interval=1,
        hyperparam_mutations={
            "lr": [1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5, 1e-5],
            "alpha": tune.uniform(0.0, 1.0),
        }
    )
    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        train_fn,
        tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(
            num_samples=4,
            scheduler=pbt_scheduler,
        ),
    )
    tuner.fit()

When the PBT scheduler is enabled, each trial variant is treated as a member of the population.
Periodically, **top-performing trials are checkpointed**
(this requires your Trainable to support :ref:`save and restore <tune-trial-checkpoint>`).
**Low-performing trials clone the hyperparameter configurations of top performers and
perturb them** slightly in the hopes of discovering even better hyperparameter settings.
**Low-performing trials also resume from the checkpoints of the top performers**, allowing
the trials to explore the new hyperparameter configuration starting from a partially
trained model (e.g. by copying model weights from one of the top-performing trials).

Take a look at :doc:`/tune/examples/pbt_visualization/pbt_visualization` to get an idea
of how PBT operates. :doc:`/tune/examples/pbt_guide` gives more examples
of PBT usage.

.. _tune-scheduler-pbt-replay:

Population Based Training Replay (tune.schedulers.PopulationBasedTrainingReplay)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tune includes a utility to replay hyperparameter schedules of Population Based Training runs.
You just specify an existing experiment directory and the ID of the trial you would
like to replay. The scheduler accepts only one trial, and it will update its
config according to the obtained schedule.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from ray.tune.schedulers import PopulationBasedTrainingReplay

    replay = PopulationBasedTrainingReplay(
        experiment_dir="~/ray_results/pbt_experiment/",
        trial_id="XXXXX_00001"
    )
    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        train_fn,
        tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(scheduler=replay)
    )
    results = tuner.fit()

See :ref:`here for an example <tune-advanced-tutorial-pbt-replay>` on how to use the
replay utility in practice.

.. _tune-scheduler-pb2:

Population Based Bandits (PB2) (tune.schedulers.pb2.PB2)
--------------------------------------------------------

Tune includes a distributed implementation of `Population Based Bandits (PB2) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02518>`__.
This algorithm builds upon PBT, with the main difference being that instead of using random perturbations,
PB2 selects new hyperparameter configurations using a Gaussian Process model.

The Tune implementation of PB2 requires GPy and sklearn to be installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install GPy sklearn


PB2 can be enabled by setting the ``scheduler`` parameter of ``tune.TuneConfig`` which is taken in by ``Tuner``, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    from ray.tune.schedulers.pb2 import PB2

    pb2_scheduler = PB2(
        time_attr='time_total_s',
        metric='mean_accuracy',
        mode='max',
        perturbation_interval=600.0,
        hyperparam_bounds={
            "lr": [1e-3, 1e-5],
            "alpha": [0.0, 1.0],
        ...
        }
    )
    tuner = tune.Tuner( ... , tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(scheduler=pb2_scheduler))
    results = tuner.fit()


When the PB2 scheduler is enabled, each trial variant is treated as a member of the population.
Periodically, top-performing trials are checkpointed (this requires your Trainable to
support :ref:`save and restore <tune-trial-checkpoint>`).
Low-performing trials clone the checkpoints of top performers and perturb the configurations
in the hope of discovering an even better variation.

The primary motivation for PB2 is the ability to find promising hyperparamters with only a small population size.
With that in mind, you can run this :doc:`PB2 PPO example </tune/examples/includes/pb2_ppo_example>` to compare PB2 vs. PBT,
with a population size of ``4`` (as in the paper).
The example uses the ``BipedalWalker`` environment so does not require any additional licenses.

.. _tune-scheduler-bohb:

BOHB (tune.schedulers.HyperBandForBOHB)
---------------------------------------

This class is a variant of HyperBand that enables the `BOHB Algorithm <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01774>`_.
This implementation is true to the original HyperBand implementation and does not implement pipelining nor
straggler mitigation.

This is to be used in conjunction with the Tune BOHB search algorithm.
See :ref:`TuneBOHB <suggest-TuneBOHB>` for package requirements, examples, and details.

An example of this in use can be found here: :doc:`/tune/examples/includes/bohb_example`.

.. _tune-resource-changing-scheduler:

ResourceChangingScheduler
-------------------------

This class is a utility scheduler, allowing for trial resource requirements to be changed during tuning.
It wraps around another scheduler and uses its decisions.

* If you are using the Trainable (class) API for tuning, your Trainable must implement ``Trainable.update_resources``,
    which will let your model know about the new resources assigned. You can also obtain the current trial resources
    by calling ``Trainable.trial_resources``.

* If you are using the functional API for tuning, get the current trial resources obtained by calling
    `tune.get_trial_resources()` inside the training function.
    The function should be able to :ref:`load and save checkpoints <tune-function-trainable-checkpointing>`
    (the latter preferably every iteration).

An example of this in use can be found here: :doc:`/tune/examples/includes/xgboost_dynamic_resources_example`.
