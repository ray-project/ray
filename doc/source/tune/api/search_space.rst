Tune Search Space API
=====================

This section covers the functions you can use to define your search spaces.

.. caution::

    Not all Search Algorithms support all distributions. In particular,
    ``tune.sample_from`` and ``tune.grid_search`` are often unsupported.
    The default :ref:`tune-basicvariant` supports all distributions.

.. tip::

    Avoid passing large objects as values in the search space, as that will incur a performance overhead.
    Use :func:`tune.with_parameters <ray.tune.with_parameters>` to pass large objects in or load them inside your trainable
    from disk (making sure that all nodes have access to the files) or cloud storage.
    See :ref:`tune-bottlenecks` for more information.

For a high-level overview, see this example:
