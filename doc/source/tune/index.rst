Tune: Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
====================================

.. image:: images/tune_overview.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

Tune is a Python library for experiment execution and hyperparameter tuning at any scale.
You can tune your favorite machine learning framework (:ref:`PyTorch <tune-pytorch-cifar-ref>`, :ref:`XGBoost <tune-xgboost-ref>`, :doc:`Scikit-Learn <examples/tune-sklearn>`, :doc:`TensorFlow and Keras <examples/tune_mnist_keras>`, and :doc:`more <examples/index>`) by running state of the art algorithms such as :ref:`Population Based Training (PBT) <tune-scheduler-pbt>` and :ref:`HyperBand/ASHA <tune-scheduler-hyperband>`.
Tune further integrates with a wide range of additional hyperparameter optimization tools, including :doc:`Ax <examples/ax_example>`, :doc:`BayesOpt <examples/bayesopt_example>`, :doc:`BOHB <examples/bohb_example>`, :doc:`Dragonfly <examples/dragonfly_example>`, :doc:`FLAML <examples/flaml_example>`, :doc:`HEBO <examples/hebo_example>`, :doc:`Hyperopt <examples/hyperopt_example>`, :doc:`Nevergrad <examples/nevergrad_example>`, :doc:`Optuna <examples/optuna_example>`, :doc:`SigOpt <examples/sigopt_example>`, :doc:`skopt <examples/skopt_example>`, and :doc:`ZOOpt <examples/zoopt_example>`.

**Click on the following tabs to see code examples for various machine learning frameworks**:

.. tabbed:: Quickstart

    To run this example, install the following: ``pip install "ray[tune]"``.

    In this quick-start example you `minimize` a simple function of the form ``f(x) = a**2 + b``, our `objective` function.
    The closer ``a`` is to zero and the smaller ``b`` is, the smaller the total value of ``f(x)``.
    We will define a so-called `search space` for  ``a`` and ``b`` and let Ray Tune explore the space for good values.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../python/ray/tune/tests/example.py
       :language: python
       :start-after: __quick_start_begin__
       :end-before: __quick_start_end__

.. tabbed:: Keras+Hyperopt

    To tune your Keras models with Hyperopt, you wrap your model in an objective function whose ``config`` you
    can access for selecting hyperparameters.
    In the example below we only tune the ``activation`` parameter of the first layer of the model, but you can
    tune any parameter of the model you want.
    After defining the search space, you can simply initialize the ``HyperOptSearch`` object and pass it to ``run``.
    It's important to tell Ray Tune which metric you want to optimize and whether you want to maximize or minimize it.

    .. literalinclude:: doc_code/keras_hyperopt.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: __keras_hyperopt_start__
        :end-before: __keras_hyperopt_end__

.. tabbed:: PyTorch+Optuna

    To tune your PyTorch models with Optuna, you wrap your model in an objective function whose ``config`` you
    can access for selecting hyperparameters.
    In the example below we only tune the ``momentum`` and learning rate (``lr``) parameters of the model's optimizer,
    but you can tune any other model parameter you want.
    After defining the search space, you can simply initialize the ``OptunaSearch`` object and pass it to ``run``.
    It's important to tell Ray Tune which metric you want to optimize and whether you want to maximize or minimize it.
    We stop tuning this training run after ``5`` iterations, but you can easily define other stopping rules as well.

    .. literalinclude:: doc_code/pytorch_optuna.py
        :language: python
        :start-after: __pytorch_optuna_start__
        :end-before: __pytorch_optuna_end__


With Tune you can also launch a multi-node :ref:`distributed hyperparameter sweep <tune-distributed-ref>`
in less than 10 lines of code.
It automatically manages :ref:`checkpoints <tune-checkpoint-syncing>` and logging to :ref:`TensorBoard <tune-logging>`.
And you can move your models from training to serving on the same infrastructure with `Ray Serve`_.

Why choose Tune?
----------------

There are many other hyperparameter optimization libraries out there.
If you're new to Tune, you're probably wondering, "what makes Tune different?"

.. dropdown:: Cutting-Edge Optimization Algorithms
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    As a user, you're probably looking into hyperparameter optimization because you want to quickly increase your
    model performance.

    Tune enables you to leverage a variety of these cutting edge optimization algorithms, reducing the cost of tuning
    by `terminating bad runs early <tune-scheduler-hyperband>`_,
    :ref:`choosing better parameters to evaluate <tune-search-alg>`, or even
    :ref:`changing the hyperparameters during training <tune-scheduler-pbt>` to optimize schedules.

.. dropdown:: First-class Developer Productivity
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    A key problem with many hyperparameter optimization frameworks is the need to restructure
    your code to fit the framework.
    With Tune, you can optimize your model just by :ref:`adding a few code snippets <tune-tutorial>`.

    Also, Tune removes boilerplate from your code training workflow,
    automatically :ref:`manages checkpoints <tune-checkpoint-syncing>` and
    :ref:`logs results to tools <tune-logging>` such as MLflow and TensorBoard, while also being highly customizable.

.. dropdown:: Multi-GPU & Distributed Training Out Of The Box
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    Hyperparameter tuning is known to be highly time-consuming, so it is often necessary to parallelize this process.
    Most other tuning frameworks require you to implement your own multi-process framework or build your own
    distributed system to speed up hyperparameter tuning.

    However, Tune allows you to transparently :ref:`parallelize across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes <tune-parallelism>`.
    Tune even has seamless :ref:`fault tolerance and cloud support <tune-distributed-ref>`, allowing you to scale up
    your hyperparameter search by 100x while reducing costs by up to 10x by using cheap preemptible instances.

.. dropdown:: Coming From Another Hyperparameter Optimization Tool?
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    You might be already using an existing hyperparameter tuning tool such as HyperOpt or Bayesian Optimization.

    In this situation, Tune actually allows you to power up your existing workflow.
    Tune's :ref:`Search Algorithms <tune-search-alg>` integrate with a variety of popular hyperparameter tuning
    libraries (see :ref:`examples <tune-examples-ref>`) and allow you to seamlessly scale up your optimization
    process - without sacrificing performance.
