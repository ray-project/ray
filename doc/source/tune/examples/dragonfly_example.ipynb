    "# Running Tune experiments with Dragonfly\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce Dragonfly, while running a simple Ray Tune experiment. Tuneâ€™s Search Algorithms integrate with Dragonfly and, as a result, allow you to seamlessly scale up a Dragonfly optimization process - without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dragonfly is an open source python library for scalable Bayesian optimization. Bayesian optimization is used optimizing black-box functions whose evaluations are usually expensive. Beyond vanilla optimization techniques, Dragonfly provides an array of tools to scale up Bayesian optimisation to expensive large scale problems. These include features/functionality that are especially suited for high dimensional spaces (optimizing with a large number of variables), parallel evaluations in synchronous or asynchronous settings (conducting multiple evaluations in parallel), multi-fidelity optimization (using cheap approximations to speed up the optimization process), and multi-objective optimisation (optimizing multiple functions simultaneously).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization does not rely on the gradient of the objective function, but instead, learns from samples of the search space. It is suitable for optimizing functions that are nondifferentiable, with many local minima, or even unknown but only testable. Therefore, it belongs to the domain of \"derivative-free optimization\" and \"black-box optimization\". In this example we minimize a simple objective to briefly demonstrate the usage of Dragonfly with Ray Tune via `DragonflySearch`. It's useful to keep in mind that despite the emphasis on machine learning experiments, Ray Tune optimizes any implicit or explicit objective. Here we assume `dragonfly-opt==0.1.6` library is installed. To learn more, please refer to the [Dragonfly website](https://dragonfly-opt.readthedocs.io/)."

    "Let's start by defining a optimization problem. Suppose we want to figure out the proportions of water and several salts to add to an ionic solution with the goal of maximizing it's ability to conduct electricity. The objective here is explicit for demonstration, yet in practice they often come out of a black-box (e.g. a physical device measuring conductivity, or reporting the results of a long-running ML experiment). We artificially sleep for a bit (`0.02` seconds) to simulate a more typical experiment. This setup assumes that we're running multiple `step`s of an experiment and try to tune relative proportions of 4 ingredients-- these proportions should be considered as hyperparameters. Our `objective` function will take a Tune `config`, evaluates the `conductivity` of our experiment in a training loop,\n",
