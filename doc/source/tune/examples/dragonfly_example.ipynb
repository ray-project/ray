    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce Dragonfly, while running a simple Ray Tune experiment.\n",
    "Tune’s Search Algorithms integrate with Dragonfly and, as a result,\n",
    "allow you to seamlessly scale up a Dragonfly optimization process - without\n",

    "Dragonfly is an open source python library for scalable Bayesian optimization.\n",
    "Bayesian optimization is used optimizing black-box functions whose evaluations\n",
    "are usually expensive. Beyond vanilla optimization techniques,\n",
    "Dragonfly provides an array of tools to scale up Bayesian optimization to expensive\n",
    "large scale problems. These include features that are especially suited for high\n",
    "dimensional spaces (optimizing with a large number of variables), parallel evaluations\n",
    "in synchronous or asynchronous settings (conducting multiple evaluations in parallel),\n",
    "multi-fidelity optimization (using cheap approximations to speed up the optimization\n",
    "process), and multi-objective optimization (optimizing multiple functions\n",
    "simultaneously).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization does not rely on the gradient of the objective function,\n",
    "but instead, learns from samples of the search space. It is suitable for optimizing\n",
    "functions that are non-differentiable, with many local minima, or even unknown but only\n",
    "testable. Therefore, it belongs to the domain of \"derivative-free optimization\" and\n",
    "\"black-box optimization\". In this example we minimize a simple objective to briefly\n",
    "demonstrate the usage of Dragonfly with Ray Tune via `DragonflySearch`. It's useful\n",
    "to keep in mind that despite the emphasis on machine learning experiments,\n",
