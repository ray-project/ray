    "## What is XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is an acronym for e**X**treme **G**radient **Boost**ing. Internally,\n",
    "XGBoost uses [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). Instead\n",
    "of training just one large decision tree, XGBoost and other related algorithms train\n",
    "many small decision trees. The intuition behind this is that even though single\n",
    "decision trees can be inaccurate and suffer from high variance,\n",
    "combining the output of a large number of these weak learners can actually lead to\n",
    "strong learner, resulting in better predictions and less variance.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} /images/tune-xgboost-ensemble.svg\n",
    ":alt: Single vs. ensemble learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A single decision tree (left) might be able to get to an accuracy of 70%\n",
    "for a binary classification task. By combining the output of several small\n",
    "decision trees, an ensemble learner (right) might end up with a higher accuracy\n",
    "of 90%.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting algorithms start with a single small decision tree and evaluate how well\n",
    "it predicts the given examples. When building the next tree, those samples that have\n",
    "been misclassified before have a higher chance of being used to generate the tree.\n",
    "This is useful because it avoids overfitting to samples that can be easily classified\n",
    "and instead tries to come up with models that are able to classify hard examples, too.\n",
    "Please see [here for a more thorough introduction to bagging and boosting algorithms](https://towardsdatascience.com/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many boosting algorithms. In their core, they are all very similar. XGBoost\n",
    "uses second-level derivatives to find splits that maximize the *gain* (the inverse of\n",
    "the *loss*) - hence the name. In practice, there really is no drawback in using\n",
    "XGBoost over other boosting algorithms - in fact, it usually shows the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training a simple XGBoost classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first see how a simple XGBoost classifier can be trained. We'll use the\n",
    "`breast_cancer`-Dataset included in the `sklearn` dataset collection. This is\n",
    "a binary classification dataset. Given 30 different input features, our task is to\n",

    "\n",
    "Even with the default settings, XGBoost was able to get to a good accuracy on the\n",
    "breast cancer dataset. However, as in many machine learning algorithms, there are\n",
    "many knobs to tune which might lead to even better performance. Let's explore some of\n",
    "them below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum tree depth\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that XGBoost internally uses many decision tree models to come up with\n",
    "predictions. When training a decision tree, we need to tell the algorithm how\n",
    "large the tree may get. The parameter for this is called the tree *depth*.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} /images/tune-xgboost-depth.svg\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    ":alt: Decision tree depth\n",
    "\n",
    "In this image, the left tree has a depth of 2, and the right tree a depth of 3.\n",
    "Note that with each level, $2^{(d-1)}$ splits are added, where *d* is the depth\n",
    "of the tree.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree depth is a property that concerns the model complexity. If you only allow short\n",
    "trees, the models are likely not very precise - they underfit the data. If you allow\n",
    "very large trees, the single models are likely to overfit to the data. In practice,\n",
    "a number between `2` and `6` is often a good starting point for this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost's default value is `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum child weight\n",
    "\n",
    "When a decision tree creates new leaves, it splits up the remaining data at one node\n",
    "into two groups. If there are only few samples in one of these groups, it often\n",
    "doesn't make sense to split it further. One of the reasons for this is that the\n",
    "model is harder to train when we have fewer samples.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure} /images/tune-xgboost-weight.svg\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    ":alt: Minimum child weight\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we start with 100 examples. At the first node, they are split\n",
    "into 4 and 96 samples, respectively. In the next step, our model might find\n",
    "that it doesn't make sense to split the 4 examples more. It thus only continues\n",
    "to add leaves on the right side.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter used by the model to decide if it makes sense to split a node is called\n",
    "the *minimum child weight*. In the case of linear regression, this is just the absolute\n",
    "number of nodes requried in each child. In other objectives, this value is determined\n",
    "using the weights of the examples, hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the value, the more constrained the trees are and the less deep they will be.\n",
    "This parameter thus also affects the model complexity. Values can range between 0\n",
    "and infinity and are dependent on the sample size. For our ca. 500 examples in the\n",
    "breast cancer dataset, values between `0` and `10` should be sensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost's default value is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsample size\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree we add is trained on a subsample of the total training dataset.\n",
    "The probabilities for the samples are weighted according to the XGBoost algorithm,\n",
    "but we can decide on which fraction of the samples we want to train each decision\n",
    "tree on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting this value to `0.7` would mean that we randomly sample `70%` of the\n",
    "training dataset before each training iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost's default value is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning rate / Eta\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that XGBoost sequentially trains many decision trees, and that later trees\n",
    "are more likely trained on data that has been misclassified by prior trees. In effect\n",
    "this means that earlier trees make decisions for easy samples (i.e. those samples that\n",
    "can easily be classified) and later trees make decisions for harder samples. It is then\n",
    "sensible to assume that the later trees are less accurate than earlier trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this fact, XGBoost uses a parameter called *Eta*, which is sometimes called\n",
    "the *learning rate*. Don't confuse this with learning rates from gradient descent!\n",
    "The original [paper on stochastic gradient boosting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167947301000652)\n",
    "introduces this parameter like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\eta \\cdot \\gamma_{lm} \\textbf{1}(x \\in R_{lm})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a complicated way to say that when we train we new decision tree,\n",
    "represented by $\\gamma_{lm} \\textbf{1}(x \\in R_{lm})$, we want to dampen\n",
    "its effect on the previous prediction $F_{m-1}(x)$ with a factor\n",
    "$\\eta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical values for this parameter are between `0.01` and `` 0.3` ``.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost's default value is `0.3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of boost rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can decide on how many boosting rounds we perform, which means how\n",
    "many decision trees we ultimately train. When we do heavy subsampling or use small\n",
    "learning rate, it might make sense to increase the number of boosting rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost's default value is `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it together\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this looks like in code! We just need to adjust our `config` dict:"

    "that will eventually show a bad performance, e.g. a low accuracy. It would be good\n",
    "if we could identify these trials early and stop them, so we don't waste any resources.\n",

    "Each of these configurations is trained for a specific number of iterations.\n",

    "example so that we can retrieve the saved model later.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters from the `eval_metrics` configuration setting are then automatically\n",
    "reported to Tune via the callback. Here, the raw error will be reported, not the accuracy.\n",
    "To display the best reached accuracy, we will inverse it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also load the best checkpointed model so that we can use it for predictions.\n",
    "The best model is selected with respect to the `metric` and `mode` parameters we\n",
