    "# Running Tune experiments with AxSearch\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce Ax, while running a simple Ray Tune experiment. Tune’s Search Algorithms integrate with Ax and, as a result, allow you to seamlessly scale up a Ax optimization process - without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ax is a platform for optimizing any kind of experiment, including machine learning experiments, A/B tests, and simulations. Ax can optimize discrete configurations (e.g., variants of an A/B test) using multi-armed bandit optimization, and continuous/ordered configurations (e.g. float/int parameters) using Bayesian optimization. Results of A/B tests and simulations with reinforcement learning agents often exhibit high amounts of noise. Ax supports state-of-the-art algorithms which work better than traditional Bayesian optimization in high-noise settings. Ax also supports multi-objective and constrained optimization which are common to real-world problems (e.g. improving load time without increasing data use). Ax belongs to the domain of  \"derivative-free\" and \"black-box\" optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we minimize a simple objective to briefly demonstrate the usage of AxSearch with Ray Tune via `AxSearch`. It's useful to keep in mind that despite the emphasis on machine learning experiments, Ray Tune optimizes any implicit or explicit objective. Here we assume `ax-platform==0.2.4` library is installed withe python version >= 3.7. To learn more, please refer to the [Ax website](https://ax.dev/)."
