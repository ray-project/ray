    "# Running Tune experiments with BayesOpt\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce BayesOpt, while running a simple Ray Tune experiment. Tune’s Search Algorithms integrate with BayesOpt and, as a result, allow you to seamlessly scale up a BayesOpt optimization process - without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "BayesOpt is a constrained global optimization package utilizing Bayesian inference on gaussian processes, where the emphasis is on finding the maximum value of an unknown function in as few iterations as possible. BayesOpt's techniques are particularly suited for optimization of high cost functions, situations where the balance between exploration and exploitation is important. Therefore BayesOpt falls in the domain of \"derivative-free\" and \"black-box\" optimization. In this example we minimize a simple objective to briefly demonstrate the usage of BayesOpt with Ray Tune via `BayesOptSearch`, including conditional search spaces. It's useful to keep in mind that despite the emphasis on machine learning experiments, Ray Tune optimizes any implicit or explicit objective. Here we assume `bayesian-optimization==1.2.0` library is installed. To learn more, please refer to [BayesOpt website](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization)."
