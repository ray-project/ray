How to Configure Persistent Storage in Ray Tune
===============================================

.. seealso::

    Before diving into storage options, one can take a look at
    :ref:`the different types of data stored by Tune <tune-persisted-experiment-data>`.

Tune allows you to configure persistent storage options to enable following use cases in a distributed Ray cluster:

- **Trial-level fault tolerance**: When trials are restored (e.g. after a node failure or when the experiment was paused),
  they may be scheduled on different nodes, but still would need access to their latest checkpoint.
- **Experiment-level fault tolerance**: For an entire experiment to be restored (e.g. if the cluster crashes unexpectedly),
  Tune needs to be able to access the latest experiment state, along with all trial
  checkpoints to start from where the experiment left off.
- **Post-experiment analysis**: A consolidated location storing data from all trials is useful for post-experiment analysis
  such as accessing the best checkpoints and hyperparameter configs after the cluster has already been terminated.
- **Bridge with downstream serving/batch inference tasks**: With a configured storage, you can easily access the models
  and artifacts generated by trials, share them with others or use them in downstream tasks.


Storage Options in Tune
-----------------------

Tune provides support for three scenarios:

1. When using cloud storage (e.g. AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) accessible by all machines in the cluster.
2. When using a network filesystem (NFS) mounted to all machines in the cluster.
3. When running Tune on a single node and using the local filesystem as the persistent storage location.
4. **(Deprecated)** When running Tune on multiple nodes and using the local filesystem of the head node as the persistent storage location.

.. note::

    A network filesystem or cloud storage can be configured for single-node
    experiments. This can be useful to persist your experiment results in external storage
    if, for example, the instance you run your experiment on clears its local storage
    after termination.

    See :class:`~ray.tune.syncer.SyncConfig` for the full set of configuration options as well as more details.


.. _tune-cloud-checkpointing:

Configuring Tune with cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all nodes in a Ray cluster have access to cloud storage, e.g. AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS),
then all experiment outputs can be saved in a shared cloud bucket.

We can configure cloud storage by telling Ray Tune to **upload to a remote** ``storage_path``:

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from ray.air.config import RunConfig

    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        trainable,
        run_config=RunConfig(
            name="experiment_name",
            storage_path="s3://bucket-name/sub-path/",
        )
    )
    tuner.fit()

Ray Tune defaults to use pyarrow to perform syncing with the specified cloud ``storage_path``.
You can also pass a custom :class:`Syncer <ray.tune.syncer.Syncer>` object
to a :class:`tune.SyncConfig <ray.tune.SyncConfig>` within the :class:`air.RunConfig <ray.air.RunConfig>`
if you want to implement custom logic for uploading/downloading from the cloud.
See :ref:`tune-cloud-syncing` and :ref:`tune-cloud-syncing-command-line-example`
for more details and examples of custom syncing.

In this example, all experiment results can be found in the shared storage at ``s3://bucket-name/sub-path/experiment_name`` for further processing.

.. note::

    The head node will not have access to all experiment results locally. If you want to process
    e.g. the best checkpoint further, you will first have to fetch it from the cloud storage.

    Experiment restoration should also be done using the experiment directory at the cloud storage
    URI, rather than the local experiment directory on the head node. See :ref:`here for an example <tune-syncing-restore-from-uri>`.



Configuring Tune with a network filesystem (NFS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all Ray nodes have access to a network filesystem, e.g. AWS EFS or Google Cloud Filestore,
they can all write experiment outputs to this directory.

All we need to do is **set the shared network filesystem as the path to save results**.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import air, tune

    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        trainable,
        run_config=air.RunConfig(
            name="experiment_name",
            storage_path="/mnt/path/to/shared/storage/",
        )
    )
    tuner.fit()

In this example, all experiment results can be found in the shared storage at ``/path/to/shared/storage/experiment_name`` for further processing.


.. _tune-default-syncing:

Configure Tune without external persistent storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a single-node cluster
************************

If you're just running an experiment on a single node (e.g., on a laptop), Tune will use the
local filesystem as the default storage location for checkpoints and other artifacts.
Results are saved to ``~/ray_results`` in a sub-directory with a unique auto-generated name by default,
unless you customize this with ``storage_path`` and ``name`` in :class:`~ray.air.RunConfig`.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from ray.air.config import RunConfig

    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        trainable,
        run_config=RunConfig(
            storage_path="/tmp/custom/storage/path",
            name="experiment_name",
        )
    )
    tuner.fit()

In this example, all experiment results can found locally at ``/tmp/custom/storage/path/experiment_name`` for further processing.


On a multi-node cluster (Deprecated)
************************************

.. warning::

    When running on multiple nodes, using the local filesystem of the head node as the persistent storage location is *deprecated*.
    If you save trial checkpoints and run on a multi-node cluster, Tune will raise an error by default, if NFS or cloud storage is not setup.
    See `this issue <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/37177>`_ for more information, including temporary workarounds
    as well as the deprecation and removal schedule.


If you're using neither a shared filesystem nor cloud storage, Ray Tune will resort to the
default mechanism of periodically synchronizing data saved on worker nodes to the head node.
This treats the head node's local filesystem as the main storage location of the distributed Tune experiment.

By default, workers will sync the entire trial directory to the head node whenever that trial saves a checkpoint.
This can be configured by ``sync_on_checkpoint`` and ``sync_period`` in :class:`SyncConfig <ray.tune.syncer.SyncConfig>`:

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    from ray.air.config import RunConfig

    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        trainable,
        run_config=RunConfig(
            name="experiment_name",
            storage_path="~/ray_results",
            sync_config=tune.SyncConfig(
                syncer="auto",
                # Sync approximately every minute rather than on every checkpoint
                sync_on_checkpoint=False,
                sync_period=60,
            )
        )
    )
    tuner.fit()

In the snippet above, we disabled forceful syncing on trial checkpoints and adjusted the sync period to 60 seconds.
Setting the sync period to a lower value (in seconds) will sync from remote nodes more often.
This will lead to more robust trial recovery, but it will also lead to more synchronization overhead.

In this example, all experiment results can found on the head node at ``~/ray_results/experiment_name`` for further processing.

.. tip::
    Please note that this approach is likely the least efficient one - you should always try to use
    shared or cloud storage if possible when training on a multi-node cluster.


Examples
--------

Let's show some examples of configuring storage location and synchronization options.
We'll also show how to resume the experiment for each of the examples, in the case that your experiment gets interrupted.
See :ref:`tune-fault-tolerance-ref` for more information on resuming experiments.

In each example, we'll give a practical explanation of how *trial checkpoints* are saved
across the cluster and the external storage location (if one is provided).
See :ref:`tune-persisted-experiment-data` for an overview of other experiment data that Tune needs to persist.


Example: Running Tune with cloud storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's assume that you're running this example script from your Ray cluster's head node.

In the example below, ``my_trainable`` is a Tune :ref:`trainable <trainable-docs>`
that implements saving and loading checkpoints.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import ray
    from ray import air, tune
    from your_module import my_trainable

    # Look for the existing cluster and connect to it
    ray.init()

    # Set the local caching directory. Results will be stored here
    # before they are synced to remote storage. This env variable is ignored
    # if `storage_path` below is set to a local directory.
    os.environ["RAY_AIR_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR"] = "/tmp/mypath"

    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        my_trainable,
        run_config=air.RunConfig(
            # Name of your experiment
            name="my-tune-exp",
            # Configure how experiment data and checkpoints are persisted.
            # We recommend cloud storage checkpointing as it survives the cluster when
            # instances are terminated and has better performance.
            storage_path="s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/",
            checkpoint_config=air.CheckpointConfig(
                # We'll keep the best five checkpoints at all times
                # (with the highest AUC scores, a metric reported by the trainable)
                checkpoint_score_attribute="max-auc",
                checkpoint_score_order="max",
                num_to_keep=5,
            ),
        ),
    )
    # This starts the run!
    results = tuner.fit()

In this example, here's how trial checkpoints will be saved:

- On head node where we are running from:
    - ``/tmp/mypath/my-tune-exp/<trial_name>/checkpoint_<step>`` (but only for trials running on this node)
- On worker nodes:
    - ``/tmp/mypath/my-tune-exp/<trial_name>/checkpoint_<step>`` (but only for trials running on this node)
- S3:
    - ``s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/my-tune-exp/<trial_name>/checkpoint_<step>`` (all trials)

.. _tune-syncing-restore-from-uri:

If this run stopped for any reason (ex: user CTRL+C, terminated due to out of memory issues),
you can resume it any time starting from the experiment checkpoint state saved in the cloud:

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune
    tuner = tune.Tuner.restore(
        "s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/my-tune-exp",
        trainable=my_trainable,
        resume_errored=True
    )
    tuner.fit()


There are a few options for restoring an experiment:
``resume_unfinished``, ``resume_errored`` and ``restart_errored``.
Please see the documentation of
:meth:`Tuner.restore() <ray.tune.tuner.Tuner.restore>` for more details.


.. _tune-default-syncing-example:

Example: Running Tune in a multi-node cluster without external persistent storage (Deprecated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, let's take a look at an example using the deprecated head node syncing behavior described above.
Again, we're running this example script from the Ray cluster's head node.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray import tune
    from your_module import my_trainable

    # Look for the existing cluster and connect to it
    ray.init()

    # This starts the run!
    tuner = tune.Tuner(
        my_trainable,
        run_config=air.RunConfig(
            name="my-tune-exp",
            storage_path="/tmp/mypath",
            checkpoint_config=air.CheckpointConfig(
                checkpoint_score_attribute="max-auc",
                checkpoint_score_order="max",
                num_to_keep=5,
            ),
        )
    )

In this example, here's how trial checkpoints will be saved:

- On head node where we are running from:
    - ``/tmp/mypath/my-tune-exp/<trial_name>/checkpoint_<step>`` (**all trials**, since they have been synced to the head node)
- On worker nodes:
    - ``/tmp/mypath/my-tune-exp/<trial_name>/checkpoint_<step>`` (but only for trials running on this node)

This experiment can be resumed from the head node:

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import tune

    tuner = tune.Tuner.restore(
        "/tmp/mypath/my-tune-exp",
        trainable=my_trainable,
        resume_errored=True
    )
    tuner.fit()
