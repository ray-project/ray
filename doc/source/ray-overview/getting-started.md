:animate: fade-in-slide-down

Ray Train abstracts away the complexity of setting up a distributed training
system.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} PyTorch

This example shows how you can use Ray Train with PyTorch.

To run this example install Ray Train and PyTorch packages:

:::{note}
```bash
pip install -U "ray[train]" torch torchvision
```
:::

Set up your dataset and model.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_setup_begin__
:end-before: __torch_setup_end__
```

Now define your single-worker PyTorch training function.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_single_begin__
:end-before: __torch_single_end__
```

This training function can be executed with:

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_single_run_begin__
:end-before: __torch_single_run_end__
:dedent: 0
```

Convert this to a distributed multi-worker training function.

Use the ``ray.train.torch.prepare_model`` and
``ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader`` utility functions to
set up your model and data for distributed training.
This automatically wraps the model with ``DistributedDataParallel``
and places it on the right device, and adds ``DistributedSampler`` to the DataLoaders.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_distributed_begin__
:end-before: __torch_distributed_end__
```

Instantiate a ``TorchTrainer``
with 4 workers, and use it to run the new training function.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_trainer_begin__
:end-before: __torch_trainer_end__
:dedent: 0
```
````

````{tab-item} TensorFlow

This example shows how you can use Ray Train to set up [Multi-worker training
with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).

To run this example install Ray Train and Tensorflow packages:

:::{note}
```bash
pip install -U "ray[train]" tensorflow
```
:::

Set up your dataset and model.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_setup_begin__
:end-before: __tf_setup_end__
```

Now define your single-worker TensorFlow training function.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_single_begin__
:end-before: __tf_single_end__
```

This training function can be executed with:

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_single_run_begin__
:end-before: __tf_single_run_end__
:dedent: 0
```

Now convert this to a distributed multi-worker training function.

1. Set the *global* batch size - each worker processes the same size
   batch as in the single-worker code.
2. Choose your TensorFlow distributed training strategy. This examples
   uses the ``MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy``.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py

## Ray Core Quickstart

Turn functions and classes easily into Ray tasks and actors,
for Python and Java, with simple primitives for building and running distributed applications.


``````{dropdown} <img src="images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px"> Core: Parallelizing Functions with Ray Tasks
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python

:::{note}
To run this example install Ray Core:

```bash
pip install -U "ray"
```
:::

Import Ray and and initialize it with `ray.init()`.
Then decorate the function with ``@ray.remote`` to declare that you want to run this function remotely.
Lastly, call the function with ``.remote()`` instead of calling it normally.
This remote call yields a future, a Ray _object reference_, that you can then fetch with ``ray.get``.

```{code-block} python

import ray
ray.init()

@ray.remote
def f(x):
    return x * x

futures = [f.remote(i) for i in range(4)]
print(ray.get(futures)) # [0, 1, 4, 9]
```

````

````{tab-item} Java

```{note}
To run this example, add the [ray-api](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ray/ray-api) and [ray-runtime](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ray/ray-runtime) dependencies in your project.
```

Use `Ray.init` to initialize Ray runtime.
Then use `Ray.task(...).remote()` to convert any Java static method into a Ray task.
The task runs asynchronously in a remote worker process. The `remote` method returns an ``ObjectRef``,
and you can fetch the actual result with ``get``.

```{code-block} java

import io.ray.api.ObjectRef;
import io.ray.api.Ray;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class RayDemo {

    public static int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Intialize Ray runtime.
        Ray.init();
        List<ObjectRef<Integer>> objectRefList = new ArrayList<>();
        // Invoke the `square` method 4 times remotely as Ray tasks.
        // The tasks will run in parallel in the background.
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            objectRefList.add(Ray.task(RayDemo::square, i).remote());
        }
        // Get the actual results of the tasks.
        System.out.println(Ray.get(objectRefList));  // [0, 1, 4, 9]
    }
}
```

In the above code block we defined some Ray Tasks. While these are great for stateless operations, sometimes you
must maintain the state of your application. You can do that with Ray Actors.

``````

``````{dropdown} <img src="images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px"> Core: Parallelizing Classes with Ray Actors
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

Ray provides actors to allow you to parallelize an instance of a class in Python or Java.
When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance
of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and
maintain its own internal state.

:::{note}
To run this example install Ray Core:

```bash
pip install -U "ray"

```{code-block} python

ray.init() # Only call this once.

@ray.remote
class Counter(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.n = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.n += 1

## Ray Cluster Quickstart

Deploy your applications on Ray clusters on AWS, GCP, Azure, and more, often with minimal code changes to your existing code.


`````{dropdown} <img src="images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px"> Clusters: Launching a Ray Cluster on AWS
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

Ray programs can run on a single machine, or seamlessly scale to large clusters.

:::{note}
To run this example install the following:

```bash
pip install -U "ray[default]" boto3
```

If you haven't already, configure your credentials as described in the https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#guide-credentials[documentation for boto3].
:::

Take this simple example that waits for individual nodes to join the cluster.

````{dropdown} example.py
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

```{literalinclude} ../../yarn/example.py
:language: python
```
````
You can also download this example from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/yarn/example.py).
Store it locally in a file called `example.py`.

To execute this script in the cloud, download [this configuration file](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/autoscaler/aws/example-minimal.yaml),
or copy it here:

````{dropdown} cluster.yaml
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

```{literalinclude} ../../../python/ray/autoscaler/aws/example-minimal.yaml
:language: yaml
```
````

Assuming you have stored this configuration in a file called `cluster.yaml`, you can now launch an AWS cluster as follows:

```bash
ray submit cluster.yaml example.py --start

````

Run the following code.
