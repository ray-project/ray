## Ray AI Runtime Quickstart

Explore Ray's full suite of libraries for end-to-end ML pipelines, with the `air` packages:

```
pip install -U "ray[air]"
```

`````{dropdown} Efficiently process your data into features.

Load data into a ``Dataset``.

```{literalinclude} ../ray-air/examples/xgboost_starter.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __air_generic_preprocess_start__
    :end-before: __air_generic_preprocess_end__
```

Preprocess your data with a ``Preprocessor``.

```{literalinclude} ../ray-air/examples/xgboost_starter.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __air_xgb_preprocess_start__
    :end-before: __air_xgb_preprocess_end__
```
`````

`````{dropdown} Scale out model training.

This example will use XGBoost to train a Machine Learning model, so, install Ray's wrapper library `xgboost_ray`:

```
pip install xgboost_ray
```

Train a model with an ``XGBoostTrainer``.

```{literalinclude} ../ray-air/examples/xgboost_starter.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __air_xgb_train_start__
    :end-before: __air_xgb_train_end__

`````

`````{dropdown} Tune the hyperparameters to find the best model with Ray Tune.

Configure the parameters for tuning:

```{literalinclude} ../ray-air/examples/xgboost_starter.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __air_xgb_tuner_start__
    :end-before: __air_xgb_tuner_end__
```

Run hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune to find the best model:

```{literalinclude} ../ray-air/examples/xgboost_starter.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __air_tune_generic_end__
    :end-before: __air_tune_generic_end__

## Ray Libraries Quickstart

Use individual libraries for single ML workloads, without having to install the full AI Runtime package. Click on the dropdowns for your workload below. 

`````{dropdown} <img src="images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px"> Data: Scalable Datasets for ML
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

Ray Data is the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray libraries and applications.
Ray Data provides basic distributed data transformations such as `map`, `filter`, and `repartition`.
They are compatible with a variety of file formats, datasources, and distributed frameworks.

````{note}
To run this example install Ray Data and Dask:

```bash
pip install -U "ray[data]" dask
```
````

Get started by creating a Dataset from synthetic data using ``ray.data.range()`` and ``ray.data.from_items()``.
A Dataset can hold either plain Python objects (schema is a Python type), or Arrow records (schema is Arrow).

```{literalinclude} ../data/doc_code/quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __create_from_python_begin__
:end-before: __create_from_python_end__
```

Datasets can be created from files on local disk or remote datasources such as S3. Any filesystem 
[supported by pyarrow](http://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.fs.FileSystem.html) can be used to specify file locations.
You can also create a ``Dataset`` from existing data in the Ray object store or Ray-compatible distributed DataFrames:

```{literalinclude} ../data/doc_code/quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __create_from_files_begin__
:end-before: __create_from_files_end__
```
Datasets can be transformed in parallel using ``.map()``. 
Transformations are executed *eagerly* and block until the operation is finished.
Datasets also supports ``.filter()`` and ``.flat_map()``.

```{literalinclude} ../data/doc_code/quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __data_transform_begin__
:end-before: __data_transform_end__
```

:animate: fade-in-slide-down

Ray Train abstracts away the complexity of setting up a distributed training
system. 

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} PyTorch

This example shows how you can use Ray Train with PyTorch.

To run this example install Ray Train and PyTorch packages:

:::{note}
```bash
pip install -U "ray[train]" torch torchvision
```
:::

Set up your dataset and model.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_setup_begin__
:end-before: __torch_setup_end__
```

Now define your single-worker PyTorch training function.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_single_begin__
:end-before: __torch_single_end__
```

This training function can be executed with:

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_single_run_begin__
:end-before: __torch_single_run_end__
:dedent: 0
```

Convert this to a distributed multi-worker training function.

Use the ``ray.train.torch.prepare_model`` and
``ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader`` utility functions to
set up your model and data for distributed training.
This automatically wraps the model with ``DistributedDataParallel``
and places it on the right device, and adds ``DistributedSampler`` to the DataLoaders.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_distributed_begin__
:end-before: __torch_distributed_end__
```

Instantiate a ``TorchTrainer``
with 4 workers, and use it to run the new training function.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/pytorch/torch_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __torch_trainer_begin__
:end-before: __torch_trainer_end__
:dedent: 0
```
````

````{tab-item} TensorFlow

This example shows how you can use Ray Train to set up [Multi-worker training
with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).

To run this example install Ray Train and Tensorflow packages:

:::{note}
```bash
pip install -U "ray[train]" tensorflow
```
:::

Set up your dataset and model.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_setup_begin__
:end-before: __tf_setup_end__
```

Now define your single-worker TensorFlow training function.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_single_begin__
:end-before: __tf_single_end__
```

This training function can be executed with:

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_single_run_begin__
:end-before: __tf_single_run_end__
:dedent: 0
```

Now convert this to a distributed multi-worker training function.

1. Set the *global* batch size - each worker processes the same size
   batch as in the single-worker code.
2. Choose your TensorFlow distributed training strategy. This examples
   uses the ``MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy``.

```{literalinclude} /../../python/ray/train/examples/tf/tensorflow_quick_start.py
:language: python
:start-after: __tf_distributed_begin__
:end-before: __tf_distributed_end__

## Ray Core Quickstart

Turn functions and classes easily into Ray tasks and actors,
for Python and Java, with simple primitives for building and running distributed applications. 


``````{dropdown} <img src="images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px"> Core: Parallelizing Functions with Ray Tasks
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Python

:::{note}
To run this example install Ray Core:

```bash
pip install -U "ray"
```
:::

Import Ray and and initialize it with `ray.init()`.
Then decorate the function with ``@ray.remote`` to declare that you want to run this function remotely.
Lastly, call the function with ``.remote()`` instead of calling it normally.
This remote call yields a future, a Ray _object reference_, that you can then fetch with ``ray.get``.

```{code-block} python

import ray
ray.init()

@ray.remote
def f(x):
    return x * x

futures = [f.remote(i) for i in range(4)]
print(ray.get(futures)) # [0, 1, 4, 9]
```

````

````{tab-item} Java

```{note}
To run this example, add the [ray-api](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ray/ray-api) and [ray-runtime](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ray/ray-runtime) dependencies in your project.
```

Use `Ray.init` to initialize Ray runtime.
Then use `Ray.task(...).remote()` to convert any Java static method into a Ray task. 
The task runs asynchronously in a remote worker process. The `remote` method returns an ``ObjectRef``,
and you can fetch the actual result with ``get``.

```{code-block} java

import io.ray.api.ObjectRef;
import io.ray.api.Ray;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class RayDemo {

    public static int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Intialize Ray runtime.
        Ray.init();
        List<ObjectRef<Integer>> objectRefList = new ArrayList<>();
        // Invoke the `square` method 4 times remotely as Ray tasks.
        // The tasks will run in parallel in the background.
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            objectRefList.add(Ray.task(RayDemo::square, i).remote());
        }
        // Get the actual results of the tasks.
        System.out.println(Ray.get(objectRefList));  // [0, 1, 4, 9]
    }
}
```

In the above code block we defined some Ray Tasks. While these are great for stateless operations, sometimes you
must maintain the state of your application. You can do that with Ray Actors.

``````{dropdown} <img src="images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px"> Core: Parallelizing Classes with Ray Actors
:animate: fade-in-slide-down

Ray provides actors to allow you to parallelize an instance of a class in Python or Java.
When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance
of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and
maintain its own internal state.
