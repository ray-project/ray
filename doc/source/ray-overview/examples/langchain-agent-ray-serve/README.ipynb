        "This project uses a microservices architecture where three independent Ray Serve applications work together.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Components\n",
        "* Agent Service (LangGraph): The \"brain\" of the operation. It orchestrates the multi-step reasoning and manages the conversation state. It's lightweight (CPU-only) and deployed with Ray Serve.\n",
        "\n",
        "* LLM Service (Ray Serve LLM): The \"language engine.\" It runs the Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-FP8 model, optimized for tool use. It's deployed with vLLM on a GPU (L4) for high-speed inference and provides an OpenAI-compatible API.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Tool Service (MCP): The \"hands.\" It exposes a weather API as a set of tools. The agent discovers these tools at runtime using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It's also a stateless, CPU-only service.\n",

        "### Benefits of this architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "This microservice architecture allows each component to scale independently. Your GPU-intensive LLM service can scale up and down based on inference demand, separate from the lightweight, CPU-based agent orchestration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key benefits using Ray and Anyscale include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Independent scaling: Scale GPUs for the LLM and CPUs for the agent/tools separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "* High availability: Zero-downtime updates and automatic recovery from failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Flexibility: Swap LLMs or add new tools simply by deploying a new service. The agent discovers them at runtime—no code changes needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Enhanced observability: Anyscale provides comprehensive logs, metrics, and tracing for each service.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`enable_auto_tool_choice=True`**: Enables the model to automatically decide when to use tools based on the input.

For more information on tool calling, see the [tool and function calling documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/serving/tool-function-calling).\n",
