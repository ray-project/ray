    "A large-size LLM typically runs on multiple nodes with multiple GPUs, prioritizing peak quality and capability: stronger reasoning, broader knowledge, longer context windows, more robust generalization. It’s the right choice when state-of-the-art results are required and higher latency, complexity, and cost are acceptable trade-offs.\n",

For smaller models, see [Deploying a small-size LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/examples/deployment-serve-llm/small-size-llm/README.html) or [Deploying a medium-size LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/examples/deployment-serve-llm/medium-size-llm/README.html).\n",

    "Deploying a 685&nbsp;B-parameter model like DeepSeek-R1 presents significant technical challenges. At this scale, the model can't fit on a single GPU or even a single node. It must be distributed across multiple GPUs and nodes using *tensor parallelism* (splitting tensors within each layer) and *pipeline parallelism* (spreading layers across devices).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying a model of this scale normally requires you to manually launch and coordinate multiple nodes, unless you use a managed platform like [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), which automates cluster scaling and node orchestration.
