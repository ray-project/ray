    "This tutorial guides you through building and deploying a **multi-agent system** where agents communicate using the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol**. The system is built on Ray Serve for scalable deployment, LangChain for agent orchestration, and MCP for tool integration.\n",

    "If you're new to Ray Serve and LangChain integration, see this **single-agent template** first:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-agent system consists of three agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather Agent** answers weather-related questions using the National Weather Service API.\n",
    "- **Research Agent** performs web searches and fetches content using Brave Search.\n",
    "- **Travel Agent** orchestrates both agents using the A2A protocol to create comprehensive travel plans, delegating tasks to the Weather Agent and Research Agent as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent runs as an independent, autoscaling service with two interfaces: **SSE** for human-to-agent chat and **A2A** for agent-to-agent communication.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Key terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Agent*: The LangChain workflow/logic that decides what actions to take and calls tools.\n",
    "- *Deployment / Service*: The Ray Serve application that hosts an agent (or MCP/LLM) behind HTTP.\n",
    "- *SSE endpoint*: Human-to-agent chat endpoint with streaming support, such as `POST /weather-agent/chat`.\n",
    "- *A2A endpoint*: Agent-to-agent endpoints for discovery and execution, such as `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` and `POST /v1/message:send`.\n",

    "**Ray Serve capabilities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoscaling**: Ray Serve automatically adjusts the number of replicas for each agent based on traffic demand, allowing GPUs for the LLM and CPUs for agents to scale independently while maintaining responsiveness during peak usage.\n",
    "- **Load balancing**: Ray Serve distributes incoming requests across available agent replicas, preventing any single instance from becoming overwhelmed and maintaining consistent performance.\n",
    "- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring capabilities provide visibility into your agents' performance, including request metrics, resource utilization, and system health indicators.\n",
    "- **Fault tolerance**: Ray Serve automatically detects and recovers from failures by restarting failed agents and redistributing requests to healthy replicas. If the Research Agent fails, the Weather Agent continues working, and the Travel Agent gracefully handles partial failures.\n",
    "- **Composition**: Build complex multi-agent workflows by orchestrating multiple deployments into a single pipeline. The Travel Agent orchestrates Weather and Research agents without knowing their implementation details, using A2A for agent communication and MCP for tool access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyscale service additional benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production ready**: Anyscale provides enterprise-grade infrastructure management and automated deployments that make your multi-agent service ready for real-world production traffic.\n",
    "- **High availability**: Advanced Availability Zone aware scheduling and zero-downtime rolling updates ensure your agents maintain high availability. See [Update an Anyscale service](https://docs.anyscale.com/services/update).\n",
    "- **Logging and tracing**: Enhanced observability with comprehensive logging, distributed tracing, and real-time monitoring dashboards that provide deep insights into agent-to-agent request flows and system performance. See [Monitor a service](https://docs.anyscale.com/services/monitoring).\n",
    "- **Head node fault tolerance**: Additional resilience through managed head node redundancy, protecting against single points of failure in your Ray cluster's coordination layer. See [Head node fault tolerance](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/resource-management/head-node-fault-tolerance).\n",

    "The configuration module [`agent_runtime/config.py`](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/doc/source/ray-overview/examples/multi_agent_a2a/content/agent_runtime/config.py) centralizes configuration loading for LLM and MCP settings from environment variables.\n",

    "- **Classes:** `LLMConfig` (LLM backend settings) and `MCPEndpoint` (MCP server configuration).\n",
    "- **Functions:** `load_llm_config()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3.2 Agent building helpers\n",

    "The agent builder module [`agent_runtime/agent_builder.py`](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/doc/source/ray-overview/examples/multi_agent_a2a/content/agent_runtime/agent_builder.py) provides factory functions for building LangChain agents, centralizing LLM setup, MCP tool discovery, and agent creation to eliminate boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions:** `build_llm()`, `load_mcp_tools()`, `build_tool_agent()`, and `build_mcp_agent()`.\n",
    "- **Logic handled:** Configuration loading, LLM construction, dynamic MCP tool discovery, and agent creation with `MemorySaver` checkpointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.3.3 SSE deployment factory\n",
    "\n",
    "The SSE deployment module [`agent_runtime/serve_deployment.py`](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/doc/source/ray-overview/examples/multi_agent_a2a/content/agent_runtime/serve_deployment.py) builds the FastAPI application and Ray Serve deployment for the human-to-agent chat interface.\n",

    "- Break tasks into sub-questions (for example, finding coordinates first).\n",

    "1. User sends: \"What's the weather in Palo Alto?\"\n",
    "1. Agent reasons: \"I need coordinates for Palo Alto.\"\n",
    "1. Agent calls `get_forecast(37.4419, -122.1430)`.\n",
    "1. MCP server fetches data from the National Weather Service API.\n",
    "1. Agent formats and returns the response.\n",

    "- Connects to Web Search MCP server endpoint.\n",
    "- Tools are auto-discovered (`brave_search`, `fetch_url`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**System prompt strategy:**\n",
    "- Break research tasks into sub-questions.\n",
    "- Use `brave_search` first to find relevant sources.\n",
    "- Use `fetch_url` to read primary sources and confirm details.\n",
    "- Never fabricate information; explicitly state when unable to verify.\n",
    "- Include sources as a bullet list of URLs in the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Request flow example:**\n",
    "1. User sends: \"What are the top attractions in Seattle?\"\n",
    "1. Agent calls `brave_search(\"Seattle top attractions\", num_results=10)`.\n",
    "1. Agent calls `fetch_url(url)` for promising results.\n",
    "1. Agent synthesizes information and includes source URLs.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Uses `build_tool_agent()` from agent runtime with explicit A2A tools.\n",

    "   - Start from the builder pattern in **5.3 The agent runtime** and adapt the existing agents to your use case.\n",
    "   - Add or modify tools and prompts, update your Agent Card metadata, and deploy with Ray Serve so you can test both **SSE (human-to-agent)** and **A2A (agent-to-agent)** flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate Langfuse for observability, prompt management, and evals**\n",
    "   - Project: [`langfuse/langfuse`](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)\n",
    "   - **LLM application observability**: Instrument your app and ingest traces to Langfuse to track LLM calls and other logic (retrieval, embedding, agent actions), inspect and debug sessions, and iterate faster.\n",
    "   - **Prompt management**: Centrally manage and version prompts; strong caching on server and client helps you iterate without adding latency.\n",
    "   - **Evaluations**: Run LLM-as-a-judge, collect user feedback, support manual labeling, and build custom evaluation pipelines through APIs and SDKs.\n",
