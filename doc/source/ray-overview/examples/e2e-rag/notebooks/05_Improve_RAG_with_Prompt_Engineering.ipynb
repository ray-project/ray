    "# Improve RAG with Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides detailed guidance on prompt engineering specifically tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Here, we explore best practices, strategies, and tips for designing effective prompts that optimize the integration of external knowledge sources with generative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to build a RAG that can answer questions related to Ray or Anyscale, but note that **we have ingested 100 docs in Notebook #2, but we only have 5 documents of Anyscale which are all related to the `Anyscale Jobs`.**. this is just for demo pupose But in real production, it's very easy to ingest more doucments and build a production ready RAG application using this improved prompts showed  in the tutorial."

    "      <b>Configure your Ray Cluster:</b> Set up your multi-node environment (including head and worker nodes) and manage resource allocation (e.g., autoscaling, GPU/CPU assignments) without the Anyscale automation. See the Ray Cluster Setup documentation for details: <a href=\"https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html\">https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html</a>.\n",

      "Anyscale Jobs are a feature designed to run discrete workloads in production, such as batch inference, bulk embeddings generation, or model fine-tuning. Here are some key points about Anyscale Jobs:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scalability**: Jobs can scale rapidly to thousands of cloud instances, adjusting computing resources to match application demand.\n",
      "- **Fault Tolerance**: Jobs include retries for failures and can automatically reschedule to an alternative cluster in case of unexpected failures, such as running out of memory.\n",
      "- **Monitoring and Observability**: Persistent dashboards allow you to observe tasks in real time, and you can receive email alerts upon successful job completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Use Anyscale Jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sign in or Sign Up**: Create an account on Anyscale.\n",
      "2. **Select Example**: Choose the Intro to Jobs example.\n",
      "3. **Launch**: Start the example, which runs in a Workspace.\n",
      "4. **Follow the Notebook**: You can follow the notebook or view it in the documentation.\n",
      "5. **Terminate Workspace**: End the Workspace when you're done.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Submitting a Job\n",
      "\n",
      "You can submit a job using the CLI or Python SDK. Here’s a basic example using the CLI:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "anyscale job submit --name=my-job \\\n",
      "  --working-dir=. --max-retries=5 \\\n",
      "  --image-uri=\"anyscale/image/IMAGE_NAME:VERSION\" \\\n",
      "  --compute-config=COMPUTE_CONFIG_NAME \\\n",
      "  -- python main.py\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Managing Dependencies\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Using a `requirements.txt` File**: Include Python package dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file.\n",
      "- **Custom Container**: For more complex dependencies, use a custom container defined in a Dockerfile.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Job Queues\n",
      "\n",
      "Job queues allow for sophisticated scheduling and execution algorithms, improving resource utilization and reducing provisioning times by enabling multiple jobs to share a single cluster. Anyscale supports various scheduling policies, including FIFO, LIFO, and priority-based scheduling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Monitoring and Alerts\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Logs**: Anyscale stores up to 30 days of logs for your job, which can be filtered using the search bar.\n",
      "- **Email Alerts**: Built-in alerts notify the job creator via email when a job succeeds or fails.\n",
      "- **Custom Dashboards**: You can set up additional alerts based on your own criteria.\n",
      "\n",

    "## Add Chat History for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat history is essential for RAG because it provides context, allowing the model to retrieve more relevant and coherent information based on past interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without chat history, the retrieval process may lack continuity, leading to responses that feel disconnected or redundant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining context also helps improve personalization, reducing the need for users to repeat information and enhancing the overall conversational experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simple include `chat_history` in the prompt and the `chat_history` just need to follow simple formats such as :\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: xxxx\n",
    "Assistant: xxxx\n",
    "User: xxxx\n",
    "Assistant: xxxx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:  In practice, it's important to define a maximum number of chat turns (N_turns) to include in the prompt to prevent exceeding the model’s context length. If the user asks too many follow-up questions, older parts of the conversation should be truncated. Additionally, for conversations beyond the defined limit (N_turns), consider summarizing older dialogue into a concise summary to preserve key context while keeping the prompt length manageable.\n"

It enables developers to easily build scalable Python applications that can run efficiently on cloud infrastructures, handling everything from job scheduling to resource management.\n",

For the CLI, you typically use the anyscale submit command along with a job configuration file that specifies your code, environment, and resource requirements. The web UI also provides a user-friendly interface to upload your code and configure job parameters.\n",

      "- **CLI Configuration**: If you're using the CLI, you can define jobs in a YAML file and submit them by referencing the YAML file. For example:\n",
      "  ```bash\n",
      "  anyscale job submit --config-file config.yaml\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  You can also specify additional options directly in the CLI command, such as the job name, working directory, maximum retries, image URI, and compute configuration. For instance:\n",

      "  anyscale job submit --name=my-job \\\n",

      "    -- python main.py\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Web UI Configuration**: The web UI allows you to upload your code and configure job parameters through a user-friendly interface. You can specify similar parameters as in the CLI, such as the job name, working directory, and compute configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dependencies Management**:\n",
      "  - **Python Packages**: You can specify Python package dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file and include it when submitting the job with the `-r` or `--requirements` flag.\n",
      "  - **Custom Containers**: For more complex dependency management, you can create a custom Docker container. This involves creating a `Dockerfile` to define your environment, building the image, and then submitting the job with the custom container.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Custom Compute Configurations**: You can define a custom cluster through a compute config or specify an existing cluster when submitting a job. This is useful for large-scale, compute-intensive jobs where you might want to avoid scheduling tasks onto the head node by setting the CPU resource on the head node to 0 in your compute config.\n",
