    "# Evaluate RAG using Batch Inference with Ray Data LLM\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to efficiently evaluate large-scale requests using batch inference with Ray Data LLM. This approach is ideal when you need to process many prompts without the overhead of real-time online inference. By following these steps, you’ll learn how to load data, generate embeddings, build retrieval-augmented prompts, and finally process them with an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous tutorial (Notebook #6), we demonstrated how to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a regular pipeline with an LLM deployed as an online service. However, this approach proved to be slow and inefficient even for 64 requests, making it unscalable for evaluating larger workloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on a production LLM API for massive requests evaluation can disrupt production stability. Moreover, deploying a separate evaluation service or API adds extra overhead, and if not properly shut down after testing, it can lead to unnecessary costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the architecture diagram for evaluating RAG using batch inference with Ray Data:\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to Decide Between Online vs. Offline Inference for LLM\n",
    "* **Online Inference:**\n",
    "Use online LLM inference (e.g., via an Anyscale Endpoint) when you require real-time responses or interactive engagement with the LLM. This approach optimizes for low latency, making it ideal for prompt-based applications where speed is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Offline Inference (Batch Inference):**\n",
    "Offline LLM inference is best suited for processing a large number of prompts within a specific time frame when real-time responsiveness is not essential. Batch inference can process requests in minutes to hours, allowing for better resource management and cost efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits of Using Batch Inference with Ray Data LLM\n",
    "* **Scalability:**\n",
    "Process large-scale datasets efficiently without the constraints of real-time latency requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimized Resource Utilization:**\n",
    "Maximize throughput by taking full advantage of available compute resources (e.g., GPUs) and scheduling jobs in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cost Efficiency:**\n",
    "Leverage cost-effective compute resources and schedule batch jobs during off-peak hours to reduce overall expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexibility and Isolation:**\n",
    "Maintain a dedicated evaluation environment that can be tuned and scaled independently from production systems, minimizing the risk of disrupting live services.\n"

This means you can increase the number of workers or the amount of memory allocated to each worker to handle larger datasets or more complex computations. The system is built to efficiently distribute tasks across multiple nodes, ensuring that your jobs can scale seamlessly as your workload grows.\\n\\n- **Fault Tolerance**: To ensure fault tolerance, Anyscale Jobs incorporates mechanisms to handle failures gracefully. If a worker node fails, the system can automatically reschedule the tasks that were running on that node to other available nodes. This ensures that your jobs continue to run even if some nodes fail, minimizing downtime and ensuring the reliability of your computations.\\n\\nThese features are crucial for running large-scale distributed computing jobs that require both high performance and reliability.

Here’s how it typically works:\\n\\n- **Resource Allocation**: Anyscale Jobs intelligently allocates resources based on the job requirements and the current state of the cluster. It takes into account factors such as the type of job (e.g., training, inference), the required hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU), and the available resources in the cluster. This ensures that each job gets the resources it needs to run efficiently.\\n\\n- **Autoscaling**: Autoscaling is a key feature that allows the system to dynamically adjust the number of resources (like nodes) based on the workload. When the demand increases, Anyscale Jobs can automatically scale up by adding more resources to handle the increased load. Conversely, when the demand decreases, it can scale down to save costs. This dynamic adjustment helps in maintaining performance while optimizing resource usage.\\n\\nThese features are crucial for managing large-scale distributed computing tasks, ensuring that jobs are completed efficiently without over-provisioning resources, which can be costly. [^Note^] Please note that the exact implementation details might vary, and for the most accurate information, it's recommended to refer to the official Anyscale documentation or support channels.\", 'batch_uuid': 'c2f4a1f51c324ab7a869761a50488ba2', 'category': 'anyscale-jobs', 'embeddings': None, 'generated_text': \"I couldn't find specific sources on Anyscale docs, but here's my understanding:\\n\\nAnyscale Jobs is designed to manage resource allocation and autoscaling efficiently to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

It allows users to define, schedule, and monitor jobs that can run across multiple machines or nodes. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n- **Job Definition**: Users define jobs by specifying the tasks that need to be executed, including the code or scripts to run, the required resources (like CPU, GPU, memory), and any dependencies.\\n- **Scheduling**: Once a job is defined, it can be scheduled to run immediately or at a specified time. Anyscale Jobs handles the scheduling and ensures that the job runs according to the specified requirements.\\n- **Execution**: The platform manages the execution of the job across the available resources, ensuring efficient use of the cluster. It can handle scaling up or down based on the job's needs.\\n- **Monitoring and Management**: Users can monitor the status of their jobs, view logs, and manage them through the Anyscale interface. This includes pausing, resuming, or stopping jobs as needed.\\n\\nThis feature is particularly useful for data scientists, researchers, and developers who need to run large-scale computations or machine learning models that require significant computational resources.

Here’s a brief overview of how they work:\\n\\n- **Definition**: Anyscale Jobs allow users to run distributed applications or tasks across multiple machines or nodes. These jobs can be anything from training machine learning models to running complex simulations.\\n\\n- **Execution**: When you submit a job to Anyscale, the platform handles the orchestration of resources, ensuring that the job is distributed across the available nodes in an optimal way. This includes managing the allocation of resources, handling failures, and scaling the job as needed.\\n\\n- **Flexibility**: Anyscale Jobs are flexible and can be configured to run in different environments, such as on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid setups. This flexibility allows users to leverage their existing infrastructure or scale out to the cloud when needed.\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Management**: Once a job is submitted, users can monitor its progress, manage its execution, and retrieve results through the Anyscale platform. This includes the ability to pause, resume, or cancel jobs as necessary.\\n\\n- **Integration**: Anyscale Jobs integrate well with other tools and services, allowing for seamless workflows and easy integration into existing development and deployment pipelines.\\n\\nI couldn't find specific sources on Anyscale docs, but here's my understanding based on the typical features of such platforms.

This flexibility means you can start developing locally and then scale up to more powerful resources as needed.\\n\\n- **Resource Management**: It handles the complexities of resource management, allowing you to focus on your application logic. Anyscale optimizes the allocation of resources to your Ray applications, ensuring efficient use of computing power.\\n\\n- **Scalability**: Anyscale makes it easier to scale Ray applications by abstracting away the complexities of scaling infrastructure. This means you can scale your applications horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by increasing the resources on existing nodes, all while maintaining performance and reliability.\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Debugging**: The platform offers tools for monitoring the performance of your Ray applications and debugging issues. This helps in maintaining the health and efficiency of your applications.\\n\\n- **Integration with Ray Ecosystem**: Anyscale integrates seamlessly with the broader Ray ecosystem, including libraries and tools built on top of Ray, such as Ray Tune for hyperparameter tuning and Ray Serve for serving machine learning models. This integration allows you to leverage the full power of the Ray ecosystem with minimal setup.\\n\\nBy providing these features, Anyscale aims to make it easier for developers and data scientists to build, deploy, and scale Ray applications efficiently.

It allows users to run large-scale computations on distributed systems without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure manually. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n- **Task Submission**: Users submit their tasks or jobs to the Anyscale platform. These tasks can range from training complex ML models to processing large datasets.\\n- **Resource Management**: Anyscale automatically manages the resources needed to run these tasks. This includes allocating the right amount of computing power, memory, and storage based on the task requirements.\\n- **Scalability**: The platform is built to scale, meaning it can handle tasks of varying sizes and complexity. Whether you're running a small experiment or a large-scale production job, Anyscale adjusts the resources accordingly.\\n- **Optimization**: Anyscale optimizes the execution of tasks to ensure they run efficiently. This includes optimizing the distribution of tasks across the available resources and managing the communication between different parts of the distributed system.\\n- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Users can monitor the progress of their tasks and debug any issues that arise. The platform provides tools and interfaces to help with this process.\\n\\nThis is a high-level overview, and the specifics can vary based on the exact features and capabilities of the Anyscale platform.

Over-provisioning can lead to wasted resources, while under-provisioning can slow down your job execution.\\n\\n- **Task Parallelism**: Utilize task parallelism effectively by breaking down your job into smaller, independent tasks that can be executed concurrently. This can significantly speed up the overall job completion time.\\n\\n- **Efficient Data Handling**: Optimize how data is loaded and processed. Use efficient data formats and avoid unnecessary data transfers between tasks. Consider using data locality to reduce network overhead.\\n\\n- **Job Scheduling**: Use Anyscale's job scheduling capabilities to manage the execution of your jobs. Prioritize critical jobs and manage the queue to avoid bottlenecks.\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Tuning**: Regularly monitor the performance of your jobs and tune parameters as needed. Use Anyscale's monitoring tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.\\n\\n- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to avoid redundant computations. Caching can be particularly effective in iterative processes where the same computations are repeated.\\n\\n- **Code Optimization**: Write efficient code. This includes optimizing algorithms, minimizing I/O operations, and using appropriate data structures.\\n\\nThese practices should help in optimizing the performance of your jobs on Anyscale.

Here’s how it can be done:\\n\\n- **Triggering Jobs**: You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to trigger Anyscale Jobs based on specific events, such as code commits or pull requests. This ensures that your ML workflows are executed automatically as part of your development process.\\n\\n- **Environment Setup**: Anyscale Jobs allows you to define the environment in which your jobs run, including dependencies and configurations. This can be managed as part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistency across different stages of your development lifecycle.\\n\\n- **Integration with Tools**: Anyscale Jobs can be integrated with various CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and others. This integration can be achieved through APIs or by using specific plugins or scripts that interact with the Anyscale platform.\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Reporting**: You can set up monitoring and reporting within your CI/CD pipeline to track the status of Anyscale Jobs. This helps in identifying any issues early in the development cycle and ensures that your ML workflows are running as expected.\\n\\n- **Scaling and Resource Management**: Anyscale Jobs provides capabilities to scale resources dynamically based on the job requirements. This can be configured as part of your CI/CD pipeline to optimize resource usage and cost.\\n\\nBy integrating Anyscale Jobs into your CI/CD pipeline, you can streamline the process of deploying and managing ML workflows, ensuring that they are tested and deployed consistently and efficiently.\", 'batch_uuid': 'c2f4a1f51c324ab7a869761a50488ba2', 'category': 'anyscale-jobs', 'embeddings': None, 'generated_text': \"I couldn't find specific sources on Anyscale docs, but here's my understanding:\\n\\nAnyscale Jobs can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and management of machine learning (ML) workflows.

This includes checking the resource allocation (CPU, memory, etc.), the environment setup, and the command that is being executed.\\n\\n3. **Resource Utilization:**\\n   - Monitor the resource utilization of the job. If the job is running slowly, it might be due to insufficient resources or inefficient resource usage. You can adjust the resource allocation based on the observed usage.\\n\\n4. **Optimize Code and Algorithms:**\\n   - If the job is slow, consider optimizing the code or algorithms used in the job. This might involve profiling the code to identify slow parts and then optimizing those sections.\\n\\n5. **Use Debugging Tools:**\\n   - Utilize debugging tools provided by Anyscale or integrate third-party tools if necessary.

Logs can provide detailed information about what went wrong, including error messages and stack traces. You can access the logs through the Anyscale console or CLI.\\n\\n2. **Review Job Configuration**: Ensure that the job configuration is correct. This includes checking the resource requirements (CPU, memory, etc.), the environment setup, and the command that is being executed. Misconfigurations can often lead to job failures or poor performance.\\n\\n3. **Resource Allocation**: Verify that the job has been allocated sufficient resources. Insufficient resources can cause performance issues or even job failures. You can adjust the resource requests in the job configuration to see if this resolves the issue.\\n\\n4. **Network Issues**: Sometimes, network issues can cause job failures. Check if there are any network-related errors in the logs. Ensure that the job has access to all necessary network resources and that there are no connectivity issues.\\n\\n5. **Dependency Issues**: Make sure that all dependencies required by the job are correctly specified and available. Missing or incorrect dependencies can lead to job failures.\\n\\n6. **Retry the Job**: Sometimes, transient issues can cause job failures. Retrying the job can help determine if the issue was temporary.\\n\\n7. **Contact Support**: If you've gone through the above steps and are still unable to resolve the issue, consider reaching out to Anyscale support for further assistance.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\\n\\n1. **Define Jobs**: First, define the individual jobs that you want to run. Each job should be configured with the necessary parameters such as the command to run, the resources required, and any environment variables.\\n\\n2. **Create Job Dependencies**: Once you have your jobs defined, you can specify dependencies between them. This is done by indicating that one job should only start after another job has completed successfully. You can do this through the Anyscale Jobs UI or by specifying dependencies in your job configuration files.\\n\\n3. **Configure Workflow**: After setting up the dependencies, you can configure the workflow to ensure that jobs are executed in the correct order. This involves setting up a job graph where each node represents a job and the edges represent dependencies.\\n\\n4. **Monitor and Manage**: Finally, monitor the execution of your jobs and manage the workflow as needed. You can view the status of each job, the progress of the workflow, and any issues that arise.\\n\\nHere’s a simple example of how you might set up a workflow with two jobs, `Job A` and `Job B`, where `Job B` depends on `Job A`:\\n\\n- **Job A**: This job runs a data preprocessing script.\\n- **Job B**: This job runs a training script that uses the preprocessed data from `Job A`.\\n\\nIn the Anyscale Jobs UI, you would create `Job A` and `Job B`, and then specify that `Job B` should only start after `Job A` has completed successfully.\\n\\nIf you are using configuration files, you might define the dependencies in a YAML file like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\njobs:\\n  - name: JobA\\n    command: \"python preprocess_data.py\"\\n    dependencies: []\\n  - name: JobB\\n    command: \"python train_model.py\"\\n    dependencies: [\"JobA\"]\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration ensures that `Job B` will only start after `Job A` has finished.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions and advanced configurations, you can refer to the Anyscale Jobs documentation or support resources.
