    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "      <b>Configure your Ray Cluster:</b> Set up your multi-node environment (including head and worker nodes) and manage resource allocation (e.g., autoscaling, GPU/CPU assignments) without the Anyscale automation. See the Ray Cluster Setup documentation for details: <a href=\"https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html\">https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html</a>.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "      <b>Manage Dependencies:</b> Install and manage dependencies on each node since you won’t have Anyscale’s Docker-based dependency management. Refer to the Ray Installation Guide for instructions on installing and updating Ray in your environment: <a href=\"https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/handling-dependencies.html\">https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/handling-dependencies.html</a>.\n",
