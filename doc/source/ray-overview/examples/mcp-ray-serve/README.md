This tutorial demonstrates how to build and deploy **custom Model Control Plane (MCP)** servers using Ray Serve in both **HTTP streaming** and **stdio** modes. MCP enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-tenant model serving by decoupling model routing from application logic.

## Prerequisites

- Ray [Serve], already included in the base Docker image
- Podman (notebooks 3-5 - to deploy MCP tools with existing docker images)
- A Brave API key set in your environment (`BRAVE_API_KEY`)
- MCP Python library

### Setting the API key

Before running notebook 3 and 4, you must set your Brave API key:
```bash
export BRAVE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Development

The application is developed on [Anyscale Workspaces](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/), which enables development without worrying about infrastructureâ€”just like working on a laptop. Workspaces come with:
- **Development tools**: Spin up a remote session from your local IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) and start coding, using the same tools you love but with the power of Anyscale's compute.
- **Dependencies**: Continue to install dependencies using familiar tools like pip. Anyscale propagates all dependencies to your cluster.

```bash
pip install -q "ray[serve]" "fastapi" "httpx" "uvicorn" "aiohttp" "tqdm"
```

* **Compute**: Leverage any reserved instance capacity, spot instance from any compute provider of your choice by deploying Anyscale into your account. Alternatively, you can use the Anyscale cloud for a full serverless experience.

  * Under the hood, a cluster spins up and is efficiently managed by Anyscale.
* **Debugging**: Leverage a [distributed debugger](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/workspaces-debugging/#distributed-debugger) to get the same VS Code-like debugging experience.

Learn more about Anyscale Workspaces in the [official documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/).

**Note**: Run the entire tutorial for free on [Anyscale](https://console.anyscale.com/)â€”all dependencies come pre-installed, and compute autoscales automatically. To run it elsewhere, install the dependencies from the [`Dockerfiles`](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/ray-overview/examples/mcp-ray-serve/build-mcp-docker-image/) provided and provision the appropriate resources..

## Production

Seamlessly integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines by leveraging the Anyscale [CLI](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-cli) or [SDK](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-sdk) to deploy [highly available services](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services) and run [reliable batch jobs](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs). Developing in an environment nearly identical to productionâ€”a multi-node clusterâ€”drastically accelerates the dev-to-prod transition. This tutorial also introduces proprietary RayTurbo features that optimize workloads for performance, fault tolerance, scale, and observability.

## No infrastructure headaches

Abstract away infrastructure from your ML/AI developers so they can focus on their core ML development. You can additionally better manage compute resources and costs with [enterprise governance and observability](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/enterprise-governance-observability) and [admin capabilities](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/overview) so you can set [resource quotas](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/resource-quotas/), set [priorities for different workloads](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/global-resource-scheduler) and gain [observability of your utilization across your entire compute fleet](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/resource-management/telescope-dashboard).
Users running on a Kubernetes cloud (EKS, GKE, etc.) can still access the proprietary RayTurbo optimizations demonstrated in this tutorial by deploying the [Anyscale Kubernetes Operator](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/kubernetes/).
