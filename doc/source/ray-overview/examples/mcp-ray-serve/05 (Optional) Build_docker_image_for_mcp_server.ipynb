    "# Build a Docker image for an MCP server \n",
    "This tutorial builds a Docker image for an MCP server using Podman, specifically tailored for deploying on Anyscale with Ray Serve. It complements the official Anthropic tutorial for [Building the MCP weather server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server), which doesn't include Docker image-building instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker simplifies the process of building and distributing MCP servers by packaging them into standardized, portable containers. This eliminates issues related to dependencies and environment configuration. It also enables streamlined cloud development—enhancing testing, security, and cross-platform deployment for agent-focused tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, you can't use the [Anyscale Docker image build farm](https://docs.anyscale.com/configuration/dependency-management/dependency-container-images/) to build this image, as it doesn't support the Docker `COPY` command from local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this tutorial shows you how to build the MCP Docker image directly from the Anyscale workspace. Alternatively, you can also [build it from your local machine](https://docs.anyscale.com/container-image/build-image-tutorial). \n",
    "\n",
    "See https://hub.docker.com/catalogs/mcp for the Docker images collection for MCP servers. "
