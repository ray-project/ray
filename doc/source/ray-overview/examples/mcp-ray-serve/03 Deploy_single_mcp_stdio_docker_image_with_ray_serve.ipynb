    "# Deploying an MCP STDIO Server as a scalable HTTP service with Ray Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying an existing MCP as a HTTP Service with Ray Serve, as shown in the tutorial, can make your service more reliable and easier to scale. This approach is beneficial for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addressing MCP stdio Mode limitations\n",
    "[MCP in stdio mode](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio), which uses standard input/output streams, is typically run locally for command-line tools or simple integrations. This makes it difficult to deploy as a service because it relies on local process communication, which isn't suitable for distributed or cloud environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the official Docker images on the “shelf” default to stdio mode, making them incompatible with remote servers and large-scale deployments. By using Ray Serve, you can expose any stdio-based MCP server as an HTTP service without modifying or rebuilding your existing Docker images. This approach delivers several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No code changes or image rebuilds**: You don’t have to rewrite your MCP server or rebuild its Docker images—Ray Serve wraps the existing container and handles the transport layer for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automatic tool discovery**: Retrieve a list of available tools via a simple HTTP GET to the /tools endpoint—no custom scripting required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standardized HTTP API**: Invoke any tool by POSTing to the /call endpoint, passing the tool name and parameters in JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cloud-native scalability**: Deploy behind load balancers, autoscale horizontally, and integrate with service meshes or API gateways as you would with any other HTTP microservice.\n",
    "\n",
    "By translating stdio-mode MCP servers into HTTP endpoints with Ray Serve, you gain the flexibility and reliability needed for production-grade deployments—without touching your existing codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Ray Serve deployment on Anyscale\n",
    "Converting MCP to a HTTP service using Ray Serve, as shown in the tutorial, addresses the deployment challenges of stdio mode. It makes the service easier to manage and deploy, especially in production, with additional features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ray Serve capabilities:**\n",
    "* **Autoscaling**: Ray Serve automatically adjusts the number of replicas based on traffic demand, ensuring your service handles increased load while maintaining responsiveness during peak usage periods.\n",
    "* **Load balancing**: Ray Serve intelligently distributes incoming requests across available replicas, preventing any single instance from becoming overwhelmed and maintaining consistent performance.\n",
    "* **Observability**: Built-in monitoring capabilities provide visibility into your service's performance, including request metrics, resource utilization, and system health indicators.\n",
    "* **Fault tolerance**: Ray Serve automatically detects and recovers from failures by restarting failed components and redistributing requests to healthy replicas, ensuring continuous service availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyscale service additional benefits:**\n",
    "* **Production ready**: Anyscale provides enterprise-grade infrastructure management and automated deployments that make your MCP service ready for real-world production traffic.\n",
    "* **[High availability](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/faq#does-services-support-multiple-availability-zones-for-high-availability)**: Advanced availability zone aware scheduling mechanisms and zero-downtime rolling updates to ensure your service maintains high availability.\n",
    "* **[Logging](https://docs.anyscale.com/monitoring/accessing-logs) and [Tracing](https://docs.anyscale.com/monitoring/tracing)**: Enhanced observability with comprehensive logging, distributed tracing, and real-time monitoring dashboards that provide deep insights into request flows and system performance.\n",
    "* **[Head node fault tolerance](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/head-node-ft/)**: Additional resilience through managed head node redundancy, protecting against single points of failure in your Ray cluster's coordination layer.\n",
    "* **Composition**: Build complex services by orchestrating multiple deployments into a single pipeline, allowing you to chain preprocessing, model inference, postprocessing, and custom logic seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "* If you want to use **off-the-shelf MCP Docker images** to deploy a scalable MCP service, this tutorial still works. However, with this approach you need to build some custom code in your agent to list and call the tools properly. \n",
    "* For **deeper integrations with Ray Serve using your own custom MCP tools**, you can also use MCP in Streamable HTTP mode with Ray Serve. See Notebook #1 and #2 for that approach. This allows you directly [integrate Claude with remote MCP servers](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-custom-integrations-using-remote-mcp). \n",

    "**Build Docker image for Ray Serve deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you need to [build a Docker image for deployment on Anyscale](https://docs.anyscale.com/configuration/dependency-management/dependency-byod/) using the [Dockerfile included in this code repo](./Dockerfile). \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that when you run `apt-get install -y podman` (e.g. installing a system package) from the workspace terminal, it only lives in the Ray head node and is not propagated to your Ray worker nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "After building the Docker image, navigate to the **Dependencies** tab in Workspaces and select the corresponding image you just created, and set the **BRAVE_API_KEY** environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    " This Docker image is provided solely to deploy the MCP with Ray Serve. Ensure that your MCP docker images, like `docker.io/mcp/brave-search`, are already published to your own private registry or public registry. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory**\n",
    "- Usually indicates Podman isn't installed correctly. Verify the Podman installation.\n",
