    "This repository provides end-to-end examples for deploying and scaling Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using Rayâ€¯Serve and Anyscaleâ€¯Service, covering both streamable HTTP and stdio transport types:\n",

    "- [**`02-Build_mcp_gateway_with_existing_ray_serve_apps.ipynb`**](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/ray-overview/examples/mcp-ray-serve/02%20Build_mcp_gateway_with_existing_ray_serve_apps.ipynb): Shows how to stand up a single MCP gateway that multiplexes requests to multiple preâ€‘existing RayÂ Serve apps under one unified `/mcp` endpoint, requiring no code changes in the underlying services.\n",

    "## Why Ray Serve for MCP\n",
    "- **Autoscaling:** Dynamically adjusts replica count to match traffic peaks and maintain responsiveness\n",
    "- **Load balancing:**  Intelligently distributes incoming requests across all replicas for steady throughput\n",
    "- **Observability:** Exposes realâ€‘time metrics on request rates, resource usage & system health\n",
    "- **Fault tolerance:** Detects failures, restarts components, and reroutes traffic to healthy replicas for continuous availability\n",
    "- **Composition:**  Chains deploymentsâ€”preâ€‘process, infer, postâ€‘process, and custom logicâ€”into a single seamless pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anyscale service benefits\n",
    "- **Production ready:**  Enterpriseâ€‘grade infrastructure management and automated deployments for realâ€‘world MCP traffic\n",
    "- **[High availability](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/faq#does-services-support-multiple-availability-zones-for-high-availability):**  Availabilityâ€‘Zoneâ€‘aware scheduling and zeroâ€‘downtime rolling updates to maximize uptime\n",
    "- **[Logging](https://docs.anyscale.com/monitoring/accessing-logs) and [tracing](https://docs.anyscale.com/monitoring/tracing):**  Comprehensive logs, distributed tracing, and realâ€‘time dashboards for endâ€‘toâ€‘end observability\n",
    "- **[Head node fault tolerance](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/head-node-ft/):**  Managed headâ€‘node redundancy to eliminate single points of failure in your Ray cluster coordination layer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ray Serve, which is included in the base Docker image\n",
    "- Podman, to deploy MCP tools with existing Docker images for notebooks 3 through 5 \n",
    "- A Brave API key set in your environment (`BRAVE_API_KEY`) for notebooks 3 and 4\n",
    "- MCP Python library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this example on your own Ray cluster or on [Anyscale workspaces](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/), which enables development without worrying about infrastructureâ€”like working on a laptop. Workspaces come with:\n",
    "- **Development tools**: Spin up a remote session from your local IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) and start coding, using the tools you're familiar with combined with the power of Anyscale's compute.\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Continue to install dependencies using familiar tools like pip. Anyscale propagates all dependencies to your cluster.\n",
    "- **Compute**: Leverage any reserved instance capacity, spot instance from any compute provider of your choice by deploying Anyscale into your account. Alternatively, you can use the Anyscale cloud for a full serverless experience.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Leverage a [distributed debugger](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/workspaces-debugging/#distributed-debugger) to get the same VS Code-like debugging experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about Anyscale Workspaces in the [official documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Run the entire tutorial for free on [Anyscale](https://console.anyscale.com/)â€”all dependencies come pre-installed, and compute autoscales automatically. To run it elsewhere, install the dependencies from the [`Dockerfiles`](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/ray-overview/examples/mcp-ray-serve/build-mcp-docker-image/) provided and provision the appropriate resources..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Seamlessly integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines by leveraging the Anyscale [CLI](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-cli) or [SDK](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-sdk) to deploy [highly available services](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services) and run [reliable batch jobs](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs). Developing in an environment nearly identical to productionâ€”a multi-node clusterâ€”drastically accelerates the dev-to-prod transition. This tutorial also introduces proprietary RayTurbo features that optimize workloads for performance, fault tolerance, scale, and observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## No infrastructure headaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract away infrastructure from your ML/AI developers so they can focus on their core ML development. You can additionally better manage compute resources and costs with [enterprise governance and observability](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/enterprise-governance-observability) and [admin capabilities](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/overview) so you can set [resource quotas](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/resource-quotas/), set [priorities for different workloads](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/global-resource-scheduler) and gain [observability of your utilization across your entire compute fleet](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/resource-management/telescope-dashboard).\n",
    "If you're running on a Kubernetes cloud (EKS, GKE, etc.), you can still access the proprietary RayTurbo optimizations demonstrated in this tutorial by deploying the [Anyscale Kubernetes operator](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/kubernetes/).\n",
