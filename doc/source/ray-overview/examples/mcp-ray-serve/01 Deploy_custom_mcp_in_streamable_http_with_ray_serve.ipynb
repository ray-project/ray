    "# Deploying a custom MCP in Streamable HTTP mode with Ray Serve\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through deploying the Weather MCP server in Streamable HTTP mode with Ray Serve and FastAPI, then tests it with a simple Python client and [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP supports three transports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#stdio): Local subprocess with newline-delimited JSON over stdin/stdout. Zero-config but only for local clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [SSE (legacy, deprecated)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse): HTTP+Server-Sent events, now deprecated in favor of a unified HTTP transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http): A single HTTP endpoint that handles both client→server POSTs and server→client GET/SSE streams. \n",
    "\n",
    "MCP in stdio mode is suitable for local or personal use, and Streamable HTTP brings **remote MCP servers** into action for enterprise and production purposes. You can also [integrate the Claude APP with remote MCP server](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-custom-integrations-using-remote-mcp). \n",

    "Integrating MCP in Streamable HTTP mode with Ray Serve on Anyscale delivers comprehensive scalability and production-grade capabilities for your AI services through two complementary layers of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ray Serve capabilities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Autoscaling**: Ray Serve automatically adjusts the number of replicas based on traffic demand, ensuring your service handles increased load while maintaining responsiveness during peak usage periods.\n",
    "* **Load balancing**: Ray Serve intelligently distributes incoming requests across available replicas, preventing any single instance from becoming overwhelmed and maintaining consistent performance.\n",
    "* **Observability**: Built-in monitoring capabilities provide visibility into your service's performance, including request metrics, resource utilization, and system health indicators.\n",
    "* **Fault tolerance**: Ray Serve automatically detects and recovers from failures by restarting failed components and redistributing requests to healthy replicas, ensuring continuous service availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyscale service additional benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Production ready**: Anyscale provides enterprise-grade infrastructure management, automated deployments that make your MCP service ready for real-world production traffic.\n",
    "* **[High availability](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/faq#does-services-support-multiple-availability-zones-for-high-availability)**: Advanced Availability Zone aware scheduling mechanisms and zero-downtime rolling updates to ensure your service maintains high availability.\n",
    "* **[Logging](https://docs.anyscale.com/monitoring/accessing-logs) and [tracing](https://docs.anyscale.com/monitoring/tracing)**: Enhanced observability with comprehensive logging, distributed tracing, and real-time monitoring dashboards that provide deep insights into request flows and system performance.\n",
    "* **[Head node fault tolerance](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/head-node-ft/)**: Additional resilience through managed head node redundancy, protecting against single points of failure in your Ray cluster's coordination layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination ensures your MCP service operates with enterprise-level reliability while optimizing resource efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n"
