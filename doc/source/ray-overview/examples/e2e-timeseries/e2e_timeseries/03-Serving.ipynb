    "- This example uses a `containerfile` to define dependencies, but you could easily use a pre-built image as well.\n",

You can chain Jobs together, store results, and then serve the application with those artifacts. From there, you can trigger updates to the service and retrigger the Jobs based on events, time, etc. While you can use the Anyscale CLI to integrate with any orchestration platform, Anyscale does support some purpose-built integrations like [Airflow](https://docs.anyscale.com/ci-cd/apache-airflow/) and [Prefect](https://github.com/anyscale/prefect-anyscale). \n",
