    "\n",
    "- **Distributed data preprocessing and model training**: Ingest and preprocess data at scale using [Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html). Then, train a distributed [DLinear model](https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear) using [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model validation using offline inference**: Evaluate the model using Ray Data offline batch inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Online model serving**: Deploy the model as a scalable online service using [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production deployment**: Create production batch Jobs for offline workloads including data prep, training, batch prediction, and potentially online Services.\n",
