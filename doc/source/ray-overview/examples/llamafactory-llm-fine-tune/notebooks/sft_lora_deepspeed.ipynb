This structure is ideal for teaching the model sophisticated tool-use behavior. To maintain role alignment in ShareGPT format, a strict turn order must be followed: `human` and `observation` (tool output) must appear in odd-numbered positions, while `gpt` and `function_call` must appear in even-numbered positions. The model learns to generate the content in the `gpt` and `function_call` turns.\n",
