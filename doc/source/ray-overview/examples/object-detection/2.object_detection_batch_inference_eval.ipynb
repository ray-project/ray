    "# Object detection batch inference on test dataset and metrics calculation \n",
    "\n",
    "The previous notebook fine-tuned a custom Faster R-CNN model for mask detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook continues with evaluations that use a test dataset and metrics calculation to assess the model quality. Evaluations are critical for verifying that your object detection model accurately identifies objects and meets performance benchmarks, such as mean Average Precision and Intersection over Union. \n",
    "\n",
    "By running these evaluations, you can pinpoint strengths and weaknesses, ensuring the model generalizes well to new data. **Ray Data on Anyscale accelerates this process by enabling parallel batch inference across multiple GPU nodes, significantly reducing evaluation time**. This streamlined workflow allows for faster iterations and timely insights into model performance, ultimately leading to more reliable deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the fine-tuned model** from the saved weights from AWS S3 to cluster storage on Anyscale.\n",
    "2. **Process test images and annotations** using a custom VOC-format datasource.\n",
    "4. **Run batch inference** using Ray Data leveraging GPU acceleration.\n",
    "5. **Evaluate model performance** using object detection metrics (calculating mAP and mAR with TorchMetrics).\n",
