    "- [**`01-Batch-Inference.ipynb`**](https://github.com/anyscale/foundational-ray-app/tree/main/notebooks/01-Batch-Inference.ipynb): ingest and preprocess data at scale using [Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html) to generate embeddings for an image dataset of different dog breeds and store them.\n",
    "- [**`02-Distributed-Training.ipynb`**](https://github.com/anyscale/foundational-ray-app/tree/main/notebooks/02-Distributed-Training.ipynb): reprocess the same data to train an image classifier using [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html) and saving model artifacts to a model registry (MLOps).\n",
    "- [**`03-Online-Serving.ipynb`**](https://github.com/anyscale/foundational-ray-app/tree/main/notebooks/03-Online-Serving.ipynb): serve a semantic search app, using [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html), that uses model predictions to filter and retrieve the most relevant images based on input queries.\n",
    "- Create production batch [**Jobs**](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs/) for offline workloads like embedding generation, model training, etc., and production online [**Services**](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/) that can scale.\n",

    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is developed on [Anyscale Workspaces](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/), which enables development without worrying about infrastructureâ€”just like working on a laptop. Workspaces come with:\n",
    "- **Development tools**: Spin up a remote session from your local IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) and start coding, using the same tools you love but with the power of Anyscale's compute.\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Continue to install dependencies using familiar tools like pip. Anyscale propagates all dependencies to your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -q \"matplotlib==3.10.0\" \"torch==2.5.1\" \"transformers==4.47.1\" \"scikit-learn==1.6.0\" \"mlflow==2.19.0\" \"ipywidgets\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compute**: Leverage any reserved instance capacity, spot instance from any compute provider of your choice by deploying Anyscale into your account. Alternatively, you can use the Anyscale cloud for a full serverless experience.\n",
    "  - Under the hood, a cluster spins up and is efficiently managed by Anyscale.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Leverage a [distributed debugger](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/workspaces-debugging/#distributed-debugger) to get the same VS Code-like debugging experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about Anyscale Workspaces in the [official documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyscale/foundational-ray-app/refs/heads/main/images/compute.png\" width=600>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Run the entire tutorial for free on [Anyscale](https://console.anyscale.com/)â€”all dependencies come pre-installed, and compute autoscales automatically. To run it elsewhere, install the dependencies from the [`containerfile`](https://github.com/anyscale/foundational-ray-app/tree/main/containerfile) and provision the appropriate GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production\n",
    "Seamlessly integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines by leveraging the Anyscale [CLI](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-cli) or [SDK](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-sdk) to deploy [highly available services](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services) and run [reliable batch jobs](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs). Developing in an environment nearly identical to productionâ€”a multi-node clusterâ€”drastically accelerates the dev-to-prod transition. This tutorial also introduces proprietary RayTurbo features that optimize workloads for performance, fault tolerance, scale, and observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## No infrastructure headaches\n",
    "Abstract away infrastructure from your ML/AI developers so they can focus on their core ML development. You can additionally better manage compute resources and costs with [enterprise governance and observability](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/enterprise-governance-observability) and [admin capabilities](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/overview) so you can set [resource quotas](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/resource-quotas/), set [priorities for different workloads](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/global-resource-scheduler) and gain [observability of your utilization across your entire compute fleet](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/resource-management/telescope-dashboard).\n",
    "Users running on a Kubernetes cloud (EKS, GKE, etc.) can still access the proprietary RayTurbo optimizations demonstrated in this tutorial by deploying the [Anyscale Kubernetes Operator](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/kubernetes/)."
