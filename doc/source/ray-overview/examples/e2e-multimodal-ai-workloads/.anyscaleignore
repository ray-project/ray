# This file is used to exclude files from Anyscale Workspaces snapshots.
# Use this to prevent large or unnecessary files from being included in your snapshots,
# which helps reduce snapshot size and creation time. See documentation for more details:
# https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/workspaces-files/#excluding-files-with-anyscaleignore
#
# Syntax examples:
# *.txt                  # Ignore files with a .txt extension at the same level as `.anyscaleignore`.
# **/*.txt               # Ignore files with a .txt extension in ANY directory.
# folder/                # Ignore all files under "folder/". The slash at the end is optional.
# folder/*.txt           # Ignore files with a .txt extension under "folder/".
# path/to/filename.py    # Ignore a specific file by providing its relative path.
# file_[1,2].txt         # Ignore file_1.txt and file_2.txt.

# Exclude Python virtual environments (.venv/) from snapshots. Virtual environments contain
# all installed Python dependencies, which can be multiple gigabytes in size. These directories
# are typically recreatable from requirements files and don't need to be included in snapshots.
# The ** pattern ensures all .venv directories are excluded regardless of location in your project.
