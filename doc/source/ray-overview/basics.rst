**Ray provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.**

Ray accomplishes this mission by:

1. Providing simple primitives for building and running distributed applications.
2. Enabling end users to parallelize single machine code, with little to zero code changes.
3. Including a large ecosystem of applications, libraries, and tools on top of the core Ray to enable complex applications.

**Ray Core** provides the simple primitives for application building.

On top of **Ray Core** are several libraries for solving problems in machine learning:

- :doc:`../tune/index`
- :ref:`rllib-index`
- :ref:`sgd-index`
- :ref:`rayserve`

There are also many :ref:`community integrations <ray-oss-list>` with Ray, including `Dask`_, `MARS`_, `Modin`_, `Horovod`_, `Hugging Face`_, `Scikit-learn`_, and others. Check out the :ref:`full list of Ray distributed libraries here <ray-oss-list>`.
