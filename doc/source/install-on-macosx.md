# Installation on Mac OS X

Ray should work with Python 2 and Python 3. We have tested Ray on OS X 10.11.

## Dependencies

To install Ray, first install the following dependencies. We recommend using
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

```
brew update
brew install cmake automake autoconf libtool boost wget

pip install numpy cloudpickle funcsigs colorama psutil redis --ignore-installed six
```

If you are using Anaconda, you may also need to run the following.

```
conda install libgcc
```

## Install Ray

Ray can be built from the repository as follows.

```
git clone https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git
cd ray/python
python setup.py install --user
```

## Test if the installation succeeded

To test if the installation was successful, try running some tests. This assumes
that you've cloned the git repository.

```
python test/runtest.py
```

## Optional - web UI

Ray's web UI requires **Python 3**. To enable the web UI to work, install these
Python packages.

```
pip install aioredis asyncio websockets
```

Then install
[polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli), which
also requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and
[Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower).

Once you've installed Polymer, run the following.

```
cd ray/webui
bower install
```

Then while Ray is running, you should be able to view the web UI at
`http://localhost:8080`.
