=================================
Quickstart using the Ray Jobs CLI
=================================


This guide walks through the Ray Jobs CLI commands available for submitting and interacting with a Ray Job.

To use the Jobs API programmatically with a Python SDK instead of a CLI, see :ref:`ray-job-sdk`.

Setup
-----

Ray Jobs is available in versions 1.9+ and requires a full installation of Ray. You can install Ray by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install "ray[default]"

See the :ref:`installation guide <installation>` for more details on installing Ray.

To submit a job, you need to send HTTP requests to a Ray Cluster.
This guide assumes that you are using a local Ray Cluster, which you can start by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    ray start --head
    # ...
    # 2022-08-10 09:54:57,664   INFO services.py:1476 -- View the Ray dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265
    # ...

This command creates a Ray head node on a local machine that you can use for development purposes.
Note the Ray Dashboard URL that appears on stdout when starting or connecting to a Ray Cluster. Use this URL later to submit a job.
For more details on production deployment scenarios, see the guides for deploying Ray on :ref:`VMs <vm-cluster-quick-start>` and :ref:`Kubernetes <kuberay-quickstart>`.


Submitting a job
----------------

Start with a sample script that you can run locally. The following script uses Ray APIs to submit a task and print its return value:

.. code-block:: python

    # script.py
    import ray

    @ray.remote
    def hello_world():
        return "hello world"

    # Automatically connect to the running Ray cluster.
    ray.init()
    print(ray.get(hello_world.remote()))

Create an empty working directory with the preceding Python script inside a file named ``script.py``. 

.. code-block:: bash

  | your_working_directory
  | ├── script.py

Next, find the HTTP address of the Ray Cluster to which you can submit a job request.
Submit jobs to the same address that the **Ray Dashboard** uses.
By default, this job uses port 8265.

If you are using a local Ray Cluster (``ray start --head``), connect directly at ``http://127.0.0.1:8265``.
If you are using a Ray Cluster started on VMs or Kubernetes, follow the instructions there for setting up network access from a client. See :ref:`Using a Remote Cluster <jobs-remote-cluster>` for tips.


To tell the Ray Jobs CLI how to find your Ray Cluster, pass the Ray Dashboard address. Set the ``RAY_ADDRESS`` environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export RAY_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1:8265"

Alternatively, you can also pass the ``--address=http://127.0.0.1:8265`` flag explicitly to each Ray Jobs CLI command, or prepend each command with ``RAY_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:8265``.

Additionally, if you wish to pass headers per HTTP request to the Cluster, use the `RAY_JOB_HEADERS` environment variable.` This environment variable must be in JSON form.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ export RAY_JOB_HEADERS='{"KEY": "VALUE"}'

To submit the job, use ``ray job submit``.
Make sure to specify the path to the working directory in the ``--working-dir`` argument.
For local clusters this argument isn't strictly necessary, but for remote clusters this argument is required in order to upload the working directory to the cluster.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py 

    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265

    # -------------------------------------------------------
    # Job 'raysubmit_inB2ViQuE29aZRJ5' submitted successfully
    # -------------------------------------------------------

    # Next steps
    #   Query the logs of the job:
    #     ray job logs raysubmit_inB2ViQuE29aZRJ5
    #   Query the status of the job:
    #     ray job status raysubmit_inB2ViQuE29aZRJ5
    #   Request the job to be stopped:
    #     ray job stop raysubmit_inB2ViQuE29aZRJ5

    # Tailing logs until the job exits (disable with --no-wait):
    # hello world

    # ------------------------------------------
    # Job 'raysubmit_inB2ViQuE29aZRJ5' succeeded
    # ------------------------------------------

This command runs the entrypoint script on the Ray Cluster's head node and waits until the job finishes. Note that it also streams the `stdout` and `stderr` of the entrypoint script back to the client (``hello world`` in this case). Ray also makes the contents of the directory passed as `--working-dir` available to the Ray job by downloading the directory to all nodes in your cluster.

.. note::

    The double dash (`--`) separates the arguments for the entrypoint command (e.g., `python script.py --arg1=val1`) from the arguments to `ray job submit`.

.. note::

    By default the entrypoint script runs on the head node. To override this behavior, specify one of the 
    `--entrypoint-num-cpus`, `--entrypoint-num-gpus`, `--entrypoint-resources`, or 
    `--entrypoint-memory` arguments to the `ray job submit` command. 
    See :ref:`Specifying CPU and GPU resources <ray-job-cpu-gpu-resources>` for more details.

Interacting with Long-running Jobs
----------------------------------

For long-running applications, you probably don't want to require the client to wait for the job to finish.
To do this, pass the ``--no-wait`` flag to ``ray job submit`` and use the other CLI commands to check on the job's status.
Try this modified script that submits a task every second in an infinite loop:

.. code-block:: python

    # script.py
    import ray
    import time

    @ray.remote
    def hello_world():
        return "hello world"

    ray.init()
    while True:
        print(ray.get(hello_world.remote()))
        time.sleep(1)

Now submit the job:

.. code-block:: shell

	$ ray job submit --no-wait --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py 
	# Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265

	# -------------------------------------------------------
	# Job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW' submitted successfully
	# -------------------------------------------------------

	# Next steps
	#   Query the logs of the job:
	# 	ray job logs raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
	#   Query the status of the job:
	# 	ray job status raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
	#   Request the job to be stopped:
	# 	ray job stop raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW

We can later get the stdout using the provided ``ray job logs`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ray job logs raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265
    # hello world
    # hello world
    # hello world
    # hello world
    # hello world

Get the current status of the job using ``ray job status``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ray job status raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265
    # Status for job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW': RUNNING
    # Status message: Job is currently running.

Finally, to cancel the job, use ``ray job stop``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ ray job stop raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265
    # Attempting to stop job raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
    # Waiting for job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW' to exit (disable with --no-wait):
    # Job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW' was stopped

    $ ray job status raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW
    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265
    # Job 'raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW' was stopped


.. _jobs-remote-cluster:

Using a remote cluster
----------------------

The preceding example is for a local Ray cluster. When connecting to a `remote` cluster, you need to access the dashboard port of the cluster over HTTP.

One way to access the port is to port forward ``127.0.0.1:8265`` on your local machine to ``127.0.0.1:8265`` on the head node. If you started your remote cluster with the :ref:`Ray Cluster Launcher <cluster-index>`, then you can set up automatic port forwarding using the ``ray dashboard`` command. See :ref:`monitor-cluster` for details.

Run the following command on your local machine, where ``cluster.yaml`` is the configuration file you used to launch your cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

    ray dashboard cluster.yaml

Once this command is running, verify that you can view the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:8265``.  
Also, verify that you set the environment variable ``RAY_ADDRESS`` to ``"http://127.0.0.1:8265"``. After this setup, you can the Jobs CLI on the local machine as in the preceding example to interact with the remote Ray cluster.

Using the CLI on Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preceding instructions still apply, but you can achieve the dashboard port forwarding using ``kubectl port-forward``:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/

Alternatively, you can set up Ingress to the dashboard port of the cluster over HTTP: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/


Dependency management
---------------------

To run a distributed application, ensure that all workers run in the same environment.
This configuration can be challenging if multiple applications in the same Ray Cluster have different and conflicting dependencies.

To avoid dependency conflicts, Ray provides a mechanism called :ref:`runtime environments <runtime-environments>`. Runtime environments allow an application to override the default environment on the Ray Cluster and run in an isolated environment, similar to virtual environments in single-node Python. Dependencies can include both files and Python packages.

The Ray Jobs API provides an option to specify the runtime environment when submitting a job. On the Ray Cluster, Ray installs the runtime environment across the workers and ensures that tasks in that job run in the same environment. To demonstrate this feature, this Python script prints the current version of the ``requests`` module in a Ray task.

.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    import requests

    @ray.remote
    def get_requests_version():
        return requests.__version__

    # Note: No need to specify the runtime_env in ray.init() in the driver script.
    ray.init()
    print("requests version:", ray.get(get_requests_version.remote()))

Submit this job using the default environment. This environment is the environment you started the Ray Cluster in.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ray job submit -- python script.py 
    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265
    # 
    # -------------------------------------------------------
    # Job 'raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD' submitted successfully
    # -------------------------------------------------------
    # 
    # Next steps
    #   Query the logs of the job:
    #     ray job logs raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD
    #   Query the status of the job:
    #     ray job status raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD
    #   Request the job to be stopped:
    #     ray job stop raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD
    # 
    # Tailing logs until the job exits (disable with --no-wait):
    # requests version: 2.28.1
    # 
    # ------------------------------------------
    # Job 'raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD' succeeded
    # ------------------------------------------

Now submit the job with a runtime environment that pins the version of the ``requests`` module:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ray job submit --runtime-env-json='{"pip": ["requests==2.26.0"]}' -- python script.py 
    # Job submission server address: http://127.0.0.1:8265

    # -------------------------------------------------------
    # Job 'raysubmit_vGGV4MiP9rYkYUnb' submitted successfully
    # -------------------------------------------------------

    # Next steps
    #   Query the logs of the job:
    #     ray job logs raysubmit_vGGV4MiP9rYkYUnb
    #   Query the status of the job:
    #     ray job status raysubmit_vGGV4MiP9rYkYUnb
    #   Request the job to be stopped:
    #     ray job stop raysubmit_vGGV4MiP9rYkYUnb

    # Tailing logs until the job exits (disable with --no-wait):
    # requests version: 2.26.0

    # ------------------------------------------
    # Job 'raysubmit_vGGV4MiP9rYkYUnb' succeeded
    # ------------------------------------------

.. note::

    If both the Driver and Job specify a runtime environment, Ray tries to merge them and raises an exception if they conflict.
