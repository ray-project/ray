Ray Clusters Overview
=====================

What is a Ray cluster?
----------------------

One of Ray's strengths is the ability to leverage multiple machines for
distributed execution. Ray is great for multiprocessing on a single machine.
However, the real power of Ray is the ability to seamlessly scale to a cluster
of machines.

A Ray cluster is a set of one or more nodes that are running Ray and share the same :ref:`head node<cluster-head-node-under-construction>`.
Ray clusters can either be a fixed-size number of nodes or :ref:`can autoscale<cluster-autoscaler-under-construction>` (i.e., automatically provision or deprovision the number of nodes in a cluster) according to the demand of the Ray workload.

How can I use Ray clusters?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ray clusters are officially supported on the following technology stacks:

* The :ref:`Ray cluster launcher on AWS and GCP<ref-cluster-quick-start-vms-under-construction>`. Community-supported Azure and Aliyun integrations also exist.
* :ref:`KubeRay, the official way to run Ray on Kubernetes<kuberay-index>`.

Advanced users may want to :ref:`deploy Ray clusters on-premise <on-prem>`
or onto infrastructure platforms not listed here by :ref:`providing a custom node provider <ref-cluster-setup-under-construction>`.

    **I want to run Ray on Kubernetes**
    ^^^
    Deploy a Ray application to a Kubernetes cluster. You can run the tutorial on a
    remote Kubernetes cluster or on your laptop via KinD.
