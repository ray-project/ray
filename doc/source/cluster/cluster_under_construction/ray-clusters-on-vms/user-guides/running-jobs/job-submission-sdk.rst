==================
Ray Job Submission
==================

.. note::

    This component is in **beta**.  APIs may change before becoming stable.  This feature requires a full installation of Ray using ``pip install "ray[default]"``.

Ray Job submission is a mechanism to submit locally developed and tested applications to a remote Ray cluster. It simplifies the experience of packaging, deploying, and managing a Ray application.



Jump to the :ref:`API Reference<ray-job-submission-api-ref>`, or continue reading for a quick overview.

Concepts
--------

- **Job**: A Ray application submitted to a Ray cluster for execution. Consists of (1) an entrypoint command and (2) a :ref:`runtime environment<runtime-environments>`, which may contain file and package dependencies.

- **Job Lifecycle**: When a job is submitted, it runs once to completion or failure. Retries or different runs with different parameters should be handled by the submitter. Jobs are bound to the lifetime of a Ray cluster, so if the cluster goes down, all running jobs on that cluster will be terminated.

- **Job Manager**: An entity external to the Ray cluster that manages the lifecycle of a job (scheduling, killing, polling status, getting logs, and persisting inputs/outputs), and potentially also manages the lifecycle of Ray clusters. Can be any third-party framework with these abilities, such as Apache Airflow or Kubernetes Jobs.

Quick Start Example
-------------------

Let's start with a sample job that can be run locally. The following script uses Ray APIs to increment a counter and print its value, and print the version of the ``requests`` module it's using:

.. code-block:: python

    # script.py

    import ray
    import requests

    ray.init()

    @ray.remote
    class Counter:
        def __init__(self):
            self.counter = 0

        def inc(self):
            self.counter += 1

        def get_counter(self):
            return self.counter

    counter = Counter.remote()

    for _ in range(5):
        ray.get(counter.inc.remote())
        print(ray.get(counter.get_counter.remote()))

    print(requests.__version__)

Put this file in a local directory of your choice, with filename ``script.py``, so your working directory will look like:

.. code-block:: bash

  | your_working_directory ("./")
  | ├── script.py


Next, start a local Ray cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

   ❯ ray start --head
    Local node IP: 127.0.0.1
    INFO services.py:1360 -- View the Ray dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265

Note the address and port returned in the terminal---this will be where we submit job requests to, as explained further in the examples below.  If you do not see this, ensure the Ray Dashboard is installed by running :code:`pip install "ray[default]"`.

At this point, the job is ready to be submitted by one of the :ref:`Ray Job APIs<ray-job-apis>`.
Continue on to see examples of running and interacting with this sample job. 

.. _ray-job-apis-under-construction-sdk:

Ray Job Submission APIs
-----------------------

Ray provides three APIs for job submission: 

* A :ref:`command line interface<ray-job-cli>`, the easiest way to get started.
* A :ref:`Python SDK<ray-job-sdk>`, the recommended way to submit jobs programmatically.
* An :ref:`HTTP REST API<ray-job-rest-api>`. Both the CLI and SDK call into the REST API under the hood.

All three APIs for job submission share the following key inputs:

* **Entrypoint**: The shell command to run the job.

    * Example: :code:`python my_ray_script.py`
    * Example: :code:`echo hello`

* **Runtime Environment**: Specifies files, packages, and other dependencies for your job.  See :ref:`Runtime Environments<runtime-environments>` for details.

    * Example: ``{working_dir="/data/my_files", pip=["requests", "pendulum==2.1.2"]}``
    * Of special note: the field :code:`working_dir` specifies the files your job needs to run. The entrypoint command will be run in the remote cluster's copy of the `working_dir`, so for the entrypoint ``python my_ray_script.py``, the file ``my_ray_script.py`` must be in the directory specified by ``working_dir``. 

        * If :code:`working_dir` is a local directory: It will be automatically zipped and uploaded to the target Ray cluster, then unpacked to where your submitted application runs.  This option has a size limit of 100 MB and is recommended for rapid iteration and experimentation.
        * If :code:`working_dir` is a remote URI hosted on S3, GitHub or others: It will be downloaded and unpacked to where your submitted application runs.  This option has no size limit and is recommended for production use.  For details, see :ref:`remote-uris`.


.. _ray-job-cli-under-construction-sdk:

CLI
^^^

The easiest way to get started with Ray job submission is to use the Job Submission CLI. 

Jump to the :ref:`API Reference<ray-job-submission-cli-ref>`, or continue reading for a walkthrough.


Using the CLI on a local cluster
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

First, start a local Ray cluster (e.g. with ``ray start --head``) and open a terminal (on the head node, which is your local machine).  

Next, set the :code:`RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    export RAY_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1:8265"

This tells the jobs CLI how to find your Ray cluster.  Here we are specifying port ``8265`` on the head node, the port that the Ray Dashboard listens on.  
(Note that this port is different from the port used to connect to the cluster via :ref:`Ray Client <ray-client>`, which is ``10001`` by default.)

Now you are ready to use the CLI.  
Here are some examples of CLI commands from the Quick Start example and their output:

.. code-block::

    ❯ ray job submit --runtime-env-json='{"working_dir": "./", "pip": ["requests==2.26.0"]}' -- python script.py

.. warning::

    When using the CLI, do not wrap the entrypoint command in quotes.  For example, use 
    ``ray job submit --working_dir="." -- python script.py`` instead of ``ray job submit --working_dir="." -- "python script.py"``.
    Otherwise you may encounter the error ``/bin/sh: 1: python script.py: not found``.

.. tip::

    If your job is stuck in `PENDING`, the runtime environment installation may be stuck.
    (For example, the `pip` installation or `working_dir` download may be stalled due to internet issues.)
    You can check the installation logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/runtime_env_setup-*.log` for details.

Using the CLI on a remote cluster
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Above, we ran the "Quick Start" example on a local Ray cluster.  When connecting to a `remote` cluster via the CLI, you need to be able to access the Ray Dashboard port of the cluster over HTTP.

One way to do this is to port forward ``127.0.0.1:8265`` on your local machine to ``127.0.0.1:8265`` on the head node. 
If you started your remote cluster with the :ref:`Ray Cluster Launcher <ref-cluster-quick-start>`, then the port forwarding can be set up automatically using the ``ray dashboard`` command (see :ref:`monitor-cluster` for details).

To use this, run the following command on your local machine, where ``cluster.yaml`` is the configuration file you used to launch your cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

    ray dashboard cluster.yaml

Once this is running, check that you can view the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:8265``.  

Next, set the :code:`RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    export RAY_ADDRESS="http://127.0.0.1:8265"

(Note that this port is different from the port used to connect to the cluster via :ref:`Ray Client <ray-client>`, which is ``10001`` by default.)

Now you will be able to use the Jobs CLI on your local machine as in the example above to interact with your remote Ray cluster.

Using the CLI on Kubernetes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The instructions above still apply, but you can achieve the dashboard port forwarding using ``kubectl port-forward``:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/

Alternatively, you can set up Ingress to the dashboard port of the cluster over HTTP: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/


.. _ray-job-sdk-under-construction-sdk:

Python SDK
^^^^^^^^^^

The Job Submission Python SDK is the recommended way to submit jobs programmatically.  Jump to the :ref:`API Reference<ray-job-submission-sdk-ref>`, or continue reading for a quick overview.

SDK calls are made via a ``JobSubmissionClient`` object.  To initialize the client, provide the Ray cluster head node address and the port used by the Ray Dashboard (``8265`` by default). For this example, we'll use a local Ray cluster, but the same example will work for remote Ray cluster addresses.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient

    # If using a remote cluster, replace 127.0.0.1 with the head node's IP address.
    client = JobSubmissionClient("http://127.0.0.1:8265")

Then we can submit our application to the Ray cluster via the Job SDK.

.. code-block:: python

    job_id = client.submit_job(
        # Entrypoint shell command to execute
        entrypoint="python script.py",
        # Runtime environment for the job, specifying a working directory and pip package
        runtime_env={
            "working_dir": "./",
            "pip": ["requests==2.26.0"]
        }
    )

.. tip::

    By default, the Ray job server will generate a new ``job_id`` and return it, but you can alternatively choose a unique ``job_id`` string first and pass it into :code:`submit_job`.
    In this case, the Job will be executed with your given id, and will throw an error if the same ``job_id`` is submitted more than once for the same Ray cluster.

Now we can write a simple polling loop that checks the job status until it reaches a terminal state (namely, ``JobStatus.SUCCEEDED``, ``JobStatus.STOPPED``, or ``JobStatus.FAILED``), and gets the logs at the end.
We expect to see the numbers printed from our actor, as well as the correct version of the :code:`requests` module specified in the ``runtime_env``.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray.job_submission import JobStatus
    import time

    def wait_until_finish(job_id):
        start = time.time()
        timeout = 5
        while time.time() - start <= timeout:
            status = client.get_job_status(job_id)
            print(f"status: {status}")
            if status in {JobStatus.SUCCEEDED, JobStatus.STOPPED, JobStatus.FAILED}:
                break
            time.sleep(1)


    wait_until_finish(job_id)
    logs = client.get_job_logs(job_id)

The output should be as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    status: JobStatus.PENDING
    status: JobStatus.RUNNING
    status: JobStatus.SUCCEEDED

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

    2.26.0

.. tip::

    Instead of a local directory (``"./"`` in this example), you can also specify remote URIs for your job's working directory, such as S3 buckets or Git repositories. See :ref:`remote-uris` for details.

A submitted job can be stopped by the user before it finishes executing.

.. code-block:: python

    job_id = client.submit_job(
        # Entrypoint shell command to execute
        entrypoint="python -c 'import time; time.sleep(60)'",
        runtime_env={}
    )
    wait_until_finish(job_id)
    client.stop_job(job_id)
    wait_until_finish(job_id)
    logs = client.get_job_logs(job_id)

To get information about all jobs, call ``client.list_jobs()``.  This returns a ``Dict[str, JobInfo]`` object mapping Job IDs to their information.

For full details, see the :ref:`API Reference<ray-job-submission-sdk-ref>`.


.. _ray-job-rest-api-under-construction-sdk:

REST API
^^^^^^^^

Under the hood, both the Python SDK and the CLI make HTTP calls to the job server running on the Ray head node. You can also directly send requests to the corresponding endpoints via HTTP if needed:

**Submit Job**

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import json
    import time

    resp = requests.post(
        "http://127.0.0.1:8265/api/jobs/",
        json={
            "entrypoint": "echo hello",
            "runtime_env": {},
            "job_id": None,
            "metadata": {"job_submission_id": "123"}
        }
    )
    rst = json.loads(resp.text)
    job_id = rst["job_id"]

**Query and poll for Job status**

.. code-block:: python

    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start <= 10:
        resp = requests.get(
            "http://127.0.0.1:8265/api/jobs/<job_id>"
        )
        rst = json.loads(resp.text)
        status = rst["status"]
        print(f"status: {status}")
        if status in {JobStatus.SUCCEEDED, JobStatus.STOPPED, JobStatus.FAILED}:
            break
        time.sleep(1)

**Query for logs**

.. code-block:: python

    resp = requests.get(
        "http://127.0.0.1:8265/api/jobs/<job_id>/logs"
    )
    rst = json.loads(resp.text)
    logs = rst["logs"]

**List all jobs**

.. code-block:: python

    resp = requests.get(
        "http://127.0.0.1:8265/api/jobs/"
    )
    print(resp.json())
    # {"job_id": {"metadata": ..., "status": ..., "message": ...}, ...}


Job Submission Architecture
----------------------------

The following diagram shows the underlying structure and steps for each submitted job.
