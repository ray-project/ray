# Ray on Kubernetes

(kuberay-index)=

## Overview

You can leverage your Kubernetes cluster as a substrate for execution of distributed Ray programs.

The KubeRay Operator provides a Kubernetes-native interface for managing Ray clusters. Each Ray
cluster consist of a head pod and collection of worker pods. Optional Ray Autoscaler support allows
the KubeRay Operator to size your Ray clusters according to the needs of your Ray workload, adding
and removing Ray pods as needed.
