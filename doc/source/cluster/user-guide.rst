Deployment Guide
================

This section explains how to set up a distributed Ray cluster and run your workloads on it.

To set up your cluster, check out the :ref:`Ray Cluster Overview <cluster-index>`, or jump to the :ref:`Ray Cluster Quick Start <ref-cluster-quick-start>`.

To trigger a Ray workload from your local machine, a CI system, or a third-party job scheduler/orchestrator via a command line interface or API call, try :ref:`Ray Job Submission <jobs-overview>`.

To run an interactive Ray workload and see the output in real time in a client of your choice (e.g. your local machine, SageMaker Studio, or Google Colab), you can use :ref:`Ray Client <ray-client>`.
