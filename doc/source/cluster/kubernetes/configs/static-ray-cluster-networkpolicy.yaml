# If your Kubernetes has a default deny network policy for pods, you need to manually apply this network policy 
# to allow the bidirectional communication among the head and worker nodes in the Ray cluster.

# The ports between the min-worker-port and max-worker-port are listed separately because targeting a range of
# ports is only available after Kubernetes v1.25 
# (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#targeting-a-range-of-ports).
