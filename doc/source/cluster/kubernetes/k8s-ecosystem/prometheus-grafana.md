# Using Prometheus and Grafana

This section will describe how to monitor Ray Clusters in Kubernetes using Prometheus & Grafana.

If you do not have any experience with Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes, watch this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy7NrYWoggjxCF3av5JKwyG7FFF9eLeL4).

## Preparation

Clone the [KubeRay repository](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) and checkout the `master` branch.
This tutorial requires several files in the repository.

## Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster with Kind

```sh
kind create cluster
```

## Step 2: Install Kubernetes Prometheus Stack via Helm chart

```sh
# Path: kuberay/
./install/prometheus/install.sh

# Check the installation
kubectl get all -n prometheus-system

# (part of the output)
# NAME                                                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
# deployment.apps/prometheus-grafana                    1/1     1            1           46s
# deployment.apps/prometheus-kube-prometheus-operator   1/1     1            1           46s
# deployment.apps/prometheus-kube-state-metrics         1/1     1            1           46s
```

* KubeRay provides an [install.sh script](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/install/prometheus/install.sh) to install the [kube-prometheus-stack v48.2.1](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/kube-prometheus-stack-48.2.1/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) chart and related custom resources, including **ServiceMonitor**, **PodMonitor** and **PrometheusRule**, in the namespace `prometheus-system` automatically.

* We made some modifications to the original `values.yaml` in kube-prometheus-stack chart to allow embedding Grafana panels in Ray Dashboard. See [overrides.yaml](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/tree/master/install/prometheus/overrides.yaml) for more details.
  ```yaml
  grafana:
    grafana.ini:
      security:
        allow_embedding: true
      auth.anonymous:
        enabled: true
        org_role: Viewer
  ```



## Step 3: Install a KubeRay operator

* Follow [this document](kuberay-operator-deploy) to install the latest stable KubeRay operator via Helm repository.

## Step 4: Install a RayCluster

```sh
# path: ray-operator/config/samples/
kubectl apply -f ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml

# Check ${RAYCLUSTER_HEAD_POD}
kubectl get pod -l ray.io/node-type=head

# Example output:
# NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# raycluster-kuberay-head-btwc2   1/1     Running   0          63s

# Wait until all Ray Pods are running and forward the port of the Prometheus metrics endpoint in a new terminal.
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 ${RAYCLUSTER_HEAD_POD} 8080:8080
curl localhost:8080

# Example output (Prometheus metrics format):
# # HELP ray_spill_manager_request_total Number of {spill, restore} requests.
# # TYPE ray_spill_manager_request_total gauge
# ray_spill_manager_request_total{Component="raylet",NodeAddress="10.244.0.13",Type="Restored",Version="2.0.0"} 0.0

# Ensure that the port (8080) for the metrics endpoint is also defined in the head's Kubernetes service.
kubectl get service

# NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                         AGE
# raycluster-kuberay-head-svc   ClusterIP   10.96.201.142   <none>        6379/TCP,8265/TCP,8080/TCP,8000/TCP,10001/TCP   106m
```

* KubeRay exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint in port **8080** via a built-in exporter by default. Hence, we do not need to install any external exporter.
* If you want to configure the metrics endpoint to a different port, see [kuberay/#954](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/pull/954) for more details.
* Prometheus metrics format:
  * `# HELP`: Describe the meaning of this metric.
  * `# TYPE`: See [this document](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/) for more details.

* Three required environment variables are defined in [ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/ray-operator/config/samples/ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml). See [Configuring and Managing Ray Dashboard](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/configure-manage-dashboard.html) for more details about these environment variables.
  ```yaml
  env:
    - name: RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST
      value: http://127.0.0.1:3000
    - name: RAY_GRAFANA_HOST
      value: http://prometheus-grafana.prometheus-system.svc:80
    - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST
      value: http://prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus.prometheus-system.svc:9090
  ```
  * Note that we do not deploy Grafana in the head Pod, so we need to set both `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` and `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`. 
    `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` is used by the head Pod to send health-check requests to Grafana in the backend.
    `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` is used by your browser to fetch the Grafana panels from the Grafana server rather than from the head Pod.
    Because we forward the port of Grafana to `127.0.0.1:3000` in this example, we set `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
  * `http://` is required.

## Step 5: Collect Head Node metrics with a ServiceMonitor

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: ray-head-monitor
  namespace: prometheus-system
  labels:
    # `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect ServiceMonitor with this label.
    release: prometheus
spec:
  jobLabel: ray-head
  # Only select Kubernetes Services in the "default" namespace.
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - default
  # Only select Kubernetes Services with "matchLabels".
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ray.io/node-type: head
  # A list of endpoints allowed as part of this ServiceMonitor.
  endpoints:
    - port: metrics
  targetLabels:
  - ray.io/cluster
```

* The YAML example above is [serviceMonitor.yaml](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/config/prometheus/serviceMonitor.yaml), and it is created by **install.sh**. Hence, no need to create anything here.
* See [ServiceMonitor official document](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#servicemonitor) for more details about the configurations.
* `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect ServiceMonitor with this label.

<div id="prometheus-can-only-detect-this-label" ></div>

  ```sh
  helm ls -n prometheus-system
  # ($HELM_RELEASE is "prometheus".)
  # NAME            NAMESPACE               REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                           APP VERSION
  # prometheus      prometheus-system       1               2023-02-06 06:27:05.530950815 +0000 UTC deployed        kube-prometheus-stack-44.3.1    v0.62.0

  kubectl get prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com -n prometheus-system -oyaml
  # serviceMonitorSelector:
  #   matchLabels:
  #     release: prometheus
  # podMonitorSelector:
  #   matchLabels:
  #     release: prometheus
  # ruleSelector:
  #   matchLabels:
  #     release: prometheus
  ```

* `namespaceSelector` and `seletor` are used to select exporter's Kubernetes service. Because Ray uses a built-in exporter, the **ServiceMonitor** selects Ray's head service which exposes the metrics endpoint (i.e. port 8080 here).
  ```sh
  kubectl get service -n default -l ray.io/node-type=head
  # NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                         AGE
  # raycluster-kuberay-head-svc   ClusterIP   10.96.201.142   <none>        6379/TCP,8265/TCP,8080/TCP,8000/TCP,10001/TCP   153m
  ```

* `targetLabels`: We added `spec.targetLabels[0].ray.io/cluster` because we want to include the name of the RayCluster in the metrics that will be generated by this ServiceMonitor. The `ray.io/cluster` label is part of the Ray head node service and it will be transformed into a `ray_io_cluster` metric label. That is, any metric that will be imported, will also contain the following label `ray_io_cluster=<ray-cluster-name>`. This may seem optional but it becomes mandatory if you deploy multiple RayClusters.

## Step 6: Collect Worker Node metrics with PodMonitors

KubeRay operator does not create a Kubernetes service for the Ray worker Pods, therefore we cannot use a Prometheus ServiceMonitor to scrape the metrics from the worker Pods. To collect worker metrics, we can use `Prometheus PodMonitors CRD` instead.

**Note**: We could create a Kubernetes service with selectors a common label subset from our worker pods, however, this is not ideal because our workers are independent from each other, that is, they are not a collection of replicas spawned by replicaset controller. Due to that, we should avoid using a Kubernetes service for grouping them together.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: ray-workers-monitor
  namespace: prometheus-system
  labels:
    # `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect PodMonitor with this label.
    release: prometheus
    ray.io/cluster: raycluster-kuberay # $RAY_CLUSTER_NAME: "kubectl get rayclusters.ray.io"
spec:
  jobLabel: ray-workers
  # Only select Kubernetes Pods in the "default" namespace.
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - default
  # Only select Kubernetes Pods with "matchLabels".
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      ray.io/node-type: worker
  # A list of endpoints allowed as part of this PodMonitor.
  podMetricsEndpoints:
  - port: metrics
```

* `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect PodMonitor with this label. See [here](#prometheus-can-only-detect-this-label) for more details.

* **PodMonitor** in `namespaceSelector` and `selector` are used to select Kubernetes Pods.
  ```sh
  kubectl get pod -n default -l ray.io/node-type=worker
  # NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  # raycluster-kuberay-worker-workergroup-5stpm   1/1     Running   0          3h16m
  ```

* `ray.io/cluster: $RAY_CLUSTER_NAME`: We also define `metadata.labels` by manually adding `ray.io/cluster: <ray-cluster-name>` and then instructing the PodMonitors resource to add that label in the scraped metrics via `spec.podTargetLabels[0].ray.io/cluster`.

## Step 7: Collect custom metrics with Recording Rules

[Recording Rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) allow us to precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) expressions and save their result as custom metrics. Note this is different from [Custom Application-level Metrics](application-level-metrics) which aim for the visibility of ray applications.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: ray-cluster-gcs-rules
  namespace: prometheus-system
  labels:
    # `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect Recording Rules with this label.
    release: prometheus
spec:
  groups:
- #  Rules within a group are run periodically with the same evaluation interval(30s in this example).
    name: ray-cluster-main-staging-gcs.rules
    # How often rules in the group are evaluated.
    interval: 30s
    rules:
    - # The name of the custom metric.
      # Also see best practices for naming metrics created by recording rules:
      # https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/rules/#recording-rules
      record: ray_gcs_availability_30d
      # PromQL expression.
      expr: |
      (
        100 * (
          sum(rate(ray_gcs_update_resource_usage_time_bucket{container="ray-head", le="20.0"}[30d]))
          /
          sum(rate(ray_gcs_update_resource_usage_time_count{container="ray-head"}[30d]))
        )
      )
```

* The PromQL expression above is: 
$$\frac{ number\ of\ update\ resource\ usage\ RPCs\ that\ have\ RTT\ smaller\ then\ 20ms\ in\ last\ 30\ days\ }{total\ number\ of\ update\ resource\ usage\ RPCs\ in\ last\ 30\ days\ }   \times 100 $$  


* The recording rule above is one of rules defined in [prometheusRules.yaml](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/config/prometheus/rules/prometheusRules.yaml), and it is created by **install.sh**. Hence, no need to create anything here.

* See [PrometheusRule official document](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#prometheusrule) for more details about the configurations.

* `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect PrometheusRule with this label. See [here](#prometheus-can-only-detect-this-label) for more details.

* PrometheusRule can be reloaded at runtime. Use `kubectl apply {modified prometheusRules.yaml}` to reconfigure the rules if needed.


## Step 8: Define Alert Conditions with Alerting Rules

[Alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) allow us to define alert conditions based on [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) expressions and to send notifications about firing alerts to [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager) which adds summarization, notification rate limiting, silencing and alert dependencies on top of the simple alert definitions.

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: ray-cluster-gcs-rules
  namespace: prometheus-system
  labels:
    # `release: $HELM_RELEASE`: Prometheus can only detect Alerting Rules with this label.
    release: prometheus
spec:
  groups:
  - name: ray-cluster-main-staging-gcs.rules
    # How often rules in the group are evaluated.
    interval: 30s
    rules:
    - alert: MissingMetricRayGlobalControlStore
      # A set of informational labels. Annotations can be used to store longer additional information compared to rules.0.labels.
      annotations:
        description: Ray GCS is not emitting any metrics for Resource Update requests
        summary: Ray GCS is not emitting metrics anymore
      # PromQL expression.
      expr: |
                      (
                       absent(ray_gcs_update_resource_usage_time_bucket) == 1
                      )
      # Time that Prometheus will wait and check if the alert continues to be active during each evaluation before firing the alert.
      # firing alerts may be due to false positives or noise if the setting value is too small.
      # On the other hand, if the value is too big, the alerts may not be handled in time.
      for: 5m
      # A set of additional labels to be attached to the alert.
      # It is possible to overwrite the labels in metadata.labels, so make sure one of the labels match the label in ruleSelector.matchLabels.
      labels:
        severity: critical
```

* The PromQL expression above checks if there is no time series exist for `ray_gcs_update_resource_usage_time_bucket` metric. See [absent()](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#absent) for more detail.

* The alerting rule above is one of rules defined in [prometheusRules.yaml](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/config/prometheus/rules/prometheusRules.yaml), and it is created by **install.sh**. Hence, no need to create anything here.

* Alerting rules are configured in the same way as recording rules.

## Step 9: Access Prometheus Web UI
```sh
# Forward the port of Prometheus Web UI in the Prometheus server Pod.
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0 -n prometheus-system 9090:9090
```

- Go to `${YOUR_IP}:9090/targets` (e.g. `127.0.0.1:9090/targets`). You should be able to see:
  - `podMonitor/prometheus-system/ray-workers-monitor/0 (1/1 up)`
  - `serviceMonitor/prometheus-system/ray-head-monitor/0 (1/1 up)`

![Prometheus Web UI](../images/prometheus_web_ui.png)

- Go to `${YOUR_IP}:9090/graph`. You should be able to query:
  - [System Metrics](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/ray-metrics.html#system-metrics)
  - [Application Level Metrics](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-observability/ray-metrics.html#application-level-metrics)
  - Custom Metrics defined in Recording Rules (e.g. `ray_gcs_availability_30d`)

- Go to `${YOUR_IP}:9090/alerts`. You should be able to see:
  - Alerting Rules (e.g. `MissingMetricRayGlobalControlStore`).

## Step 10: Access Grafana

```sh
# Forward the port of Grafana
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 deployment/prometheus-grafana -n prometheus-system 3000:3000
# Note: You need to update `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` if you expose Grafana to a different port.

# Check ${YOUR_IP}:3000/login for the Grafana login page (e.g. 127.0.0.1:3000/login).
# The default username is "admin" and the password is "prom-operator".
```

> Note: `kubectl port-forward` is not recommended for production use.
Refer to [this Grafana document](https://grafana.com/tutorials/run-grafana-behind-a-proxy/) for exposing Grafana behind a reverse proxy.

* The default password is defined by `grafana.adminPassword` in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml) of the kube-prometheus-stack chart.

* After logging in to Grafana successfully, we can import Ray Dashboard into Grafana via **dashboard_default.json**.
  * Click "Dashboards" icon in the left panel.
  * Click "New".
  * Click "Import".
  * Click "Upload JSON file".
  * Choose a JSON file.
    * Case 1: If you are using Ray 2.5.0, you can use [config/grafana/default_grafana_dashboard.json](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/config/grafana/default_grafana_dashboard.json).
    * Case 2: Otherwise, you should import the `default_grafana_dashboard.json` file from `/tmp/ray/session_latest/metrics/grafana/dashboards/` in the head Pod. You can use `kubectl cp` to copy the file from the head Pod to your local machine.
  * Click "Import".

* TODO: Note that importing the dashboard manually is not ideal. We should find a way to import the dashboard automatically.

![Grafana Ray Dashboard](../images/grafana_ray_dashboard.png)

## Step 11: Embed Grafana panels in Ray Dashboard

```sh
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/raycluster-embed-grafana-head-svc 8265:8265
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8265/#/metrics in your browser.
```
