To learn about RayCluster configuration, we recommend taking a look at
the {ref}`configuration guide <kuberay-config>`.

For comprehensive coverage of all supported RayCluster fields,
refer to the [API reference][APIReference].

## KubeRay API compatibility and guarantees

v1 APIs in the KubeRay project are stable and suitable for production environments.
While KubeRay maintainers strive to maintain backward compatibility, they reserve the right to deprecate API fields.
They will clearly communicate the deprecation status, and may remove the APIs after a minimum of two minor releases.
This policy allows for the necessary evolution of the API while providing a reasonable transition period for users.
