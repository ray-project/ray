# Developing Ray Serve Python scripts on a RayCluster

In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively debug your Ray Serve scripts against a RayCluster, enabling enhanced observability and faster iteration speed compared to developing the script directly with a RayService.
Many RayService issues are related to the Ray Serve Python scripts, so it is important to ensure the correctness of the scripts before deploying them to a RayService.
This tutorial will show you how to develop a Ray Serve Python script for a MobileNet image classifier on a RayCluster.
You can deploy and serve the classifier on your local Kind cluster without requiring a GPU.
Please refer to [ray-service.mobilenet.yaml](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/ray-operator/config/samples/ray-service.mobilenet.yaml) and [mobilenet-rayservice.md](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay/blob/master/docs/guidance/mobilenet-rayservice.md) for more details.


# Step 1: Install a KubeRay cluster

Follow [this document](kuberay-operator-deploy) to install the latest stable KubeRay operator via Helm repository.

# Step 2: Create a RayCluster CR

```sh
helm install raycluster kuberay/ray-cluster --version 0.6.0
```

# Step 3: Log in to the head Pod

```sh
export HEAD_POD=$(kubectl get pods --selector=ray.io/node-type=head -o custom-columns=POD:metadata.name --no-headers)
kubectl exec -it $HEAD_POD -- bash
```

# Step 4: Prepare your Ray Serve Python scripts and run the Ray Serve application

```sh
# Execute the following command in the head Pod
git clone https://github.com/ray-project/serve_config_examples.git
cd serve_config_examples

# Try to launch the Ray Serve application
serve run mobilenet.mobilenet:app
# [Error message]
#     from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
```

* `serve run mobilenet.mobilenet:app`: The first `mobilenet` is the name of the directory in the `serve_config_examples/`,
the second `mobilenet` is the name of the Python file in the directory `mobilenet/`, and `app` is the name of the variable representing Ray Serve application within the Python file. See the section "import_path" in [rayservice-troubleshooting.md](kuberay-raysvc-troubleshoot) for more details.

# Step 5: Change the Ray image from `rayproject/ray:${RAY_VERSION}` to `rayproject/ray-ml:${RAY_VERSION}`

```sh
# Uninstall RayCluster
helm uninstall raycluster

# Install the RayCluster CR with the Ray image `rayproject/ray-ml:${RAY_VERSION}`
helm install raycluster kuberay/ray-cluster --version 0.6.0 --set image.repository=rayproject/ray-ml
```

The error message in Step 4 indicates that the Ray image `rayproject/ray:${RAY_VERSION}` does not have the TensorFlow package.
Due to the significant size of TensorFlow, we have opted to use an image with TensorFlow as the base instead of installing it within {ref}`Runtime Environments <runtime-environments>`.
In this Step, we will change the Ray image from `rayproject/ray:${RAY_VERSION}` to `rayproject/ray-ml:${RAY_VERSION}`.

# Step 6: Repeat Step 3 and Step 4

```sh
# Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 to log in to the new head Pod and run the Ray Serve application.
# You should successfully launch the Ray Serve application this time.
serve run mobilenet.mobilenet:app

# [Example output]
# (ServeReplica:default_ImageClassifier pid=139, ip=10.244.0.8) Downloading data from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/keras-applications/mobilenet_v2/mobilenet_v2_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_1.0_224.h5

```

# Step 7: Submit a request to the Ray Serve application

```sh
# (On your local machine) Forward the serve port of the head Pod
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 $HEAD_POD 8000

# Clone the repository on your local machine
git clone https://github.com/ray-project/serve_config_examples.git
cd serve_config_examples/mobilenet

# Prepare a sample image file. `stable_diffusion_example.png` is a cat image generated by the Stable Diffusion model.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/kuberay/master/docs/images/stable_diffusion_example.png

# Update `image_path` in `mobilenet_req.py` to the path of `stable_diffusion_example.png`
# Send a request to the Ray Serve application.
python3 mobilenet_req.py

# [Error message]
# Unexpected error, traceback: ray::ServeReplica:default_ImageClassifier.handle_request() (pid=139, ip=10.244.0.8)
#   File "/home/ray/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/serve/_private/utils.py", line 254, in wrap_to_ray_error
#     raise exception
#   File "/home/ray/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/serve/_private/replica.py", line 550, in invoke_single
#     result = await method_to_call(*args, **kwargs)
#   File "./mobilenet/mobilenet.py", line 24, in __call__
#   File "/home/ray/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/starlette/requests.py", line 256, in _get_form
#     ), "The `python-multipart` library must be installed to use form parsing."
# AssertionError: The `python-multipart` library must be installed to use form parsing..
```

`python-multipart` is required for the request parsing function `starlette.requests.form()`, so the error message is reported when we send a request to the Ray Serve application.

# Step 8: Restart the Ray Serve application with runtime environment.

```sh
# In the head Pod, stop the Ray Serve application
serve shutdown

# Check the Ray Serve application status
serve status
# [Example output]
# There are no applications running on this cluster.

# Launch the Ray Serve application with runtime environment.
serve run mobilenet.mobilenet:app --runtime-env-json='{"pip": ["python-multipart==0.0.6"]}'

# (On your local machine) Submit a request to the Ray Serve application again, and you should get the correct prediction.
python3 mobilenet_req.py
# [Example output]
# {"prediction": ["n02123159", "tiger_cat", 0.2994779646396637]}
```

# Step 9: Create a RayService YAML file

In the previous steps, we found that the Ray Serve application can be successfully launched using the Ray image `rayproject/ray-ml:${RAY_VERSION}` and the {ref}`runtime environments <runtime-environments>` `python-multipart==0.0.6`.
Therefore, we can create a RayService YAML file with the same Ray image and runtime environment.
