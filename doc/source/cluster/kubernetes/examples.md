:::{note}
To learn the basics of Ray on Kubernetes, we recommend taking a look
at the {ref}`introductory guide <kuberay-quickstart>` first.

If you are new to your cloud provider's Kubernetes service, we recommend
taking a look at the documentation links collected {ref}`here <kuberay-k8s-setup>`

This section presents example Ray workloads to try out on your Kubernetes cluster.

More examples will be added in the future. Running the distributed XGBoost example below is a
great way to start experimenting with production Ray workloads on Kubernetes.
