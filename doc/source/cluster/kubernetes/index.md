# Ray on Kubernetes
(kuberay-index)=
## Overview

In this section we cover how to execute your distributed Ray programs on a Kubernetes cluster.

Using the [KubeRay Operator](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) is the
recommended way to do so. The operator provides a Kubernetes-native way to manage Ray clusters.
Each Ray cluster consists of a head node pod and a collection of worker node pods. Optional
autoscaling support allows the KubeRay Operator to size your Ray clusters according to the
requirements of your Ray workload, adding and removing Ray pods as needed. KubeRay supports
heterogenous compute nodes (including GPUs) as well as running multiple Ray clusters with
different Ray versions in the same Kubernetes cluster.

```

KubeRay introduces three distinct Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): **RayCluster**, **RayJob**, and **RayService**.
These CRDs assist users in efficiently managing Ray clusters tailored to various use cases.

See [Getting Started](kuberay-quickstart) to learn the basics of KubeRay and follow the quickstart guides to run your first Ray application on Kubernetes with KubeRay.
