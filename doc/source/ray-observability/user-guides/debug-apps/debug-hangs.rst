Debugging Hangs
===============
View stack traces in Ray Dashboard
-----------------------------------
The :ref:`Ray dashboard <observability-getting-started>`  lets you profile Ray Driver or Worker processes, by clicking on the "CPU profiling" or "Stack Trace" actions for active Worker processes, Tasks, Actors, and Job's driver process.

Clicking "Stack Trace" will return the current stack trace sample using ``py-spy``. By default, only the Python stack
trace is shown. To show native code frames, set the URL parameter ``native=1`` (only supported on Linux).

.. note::
   You may run into permission errors when using py-spy in the docker containers. To fix the issue:
   
   * if you start Ray manually in a Docker container, follow the `py-spy documentation`_ to resolve it. 
   * if you are a KubeRay user, follow the :ref:`guide to configure KubeRay <kuberay-pyspy-integration>` and resolve it.

Use ``ray stack`` CLI command
------------------------------

Once ``py-spy`` is installed (it is automatically installed if "Ray Dashboard" component is included when :ref:`installing Ray <installation>`), you can run ``ray stack`` to dump the stack traces of all Ray Worker processes on
the current node.

This document discusses some common problems that people run into when using Ray
as well as some known problems. If you encounter other problems, please
