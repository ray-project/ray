Optimizing Performance
======================

No speedup
----------

You just ran an application using Ray, but it wasn't as fast as you expected it
to be. Or worse, perhaps it was slower than the serial version of the
application! The most common reasons are the following.

- **Number of cores:** How many cores is Ray using? When you start Ray, it will
  determine the number of CPUs on each machine with ``psutil.cpu_count()``. Ray
  usually will not schedule more tasks in parallel than the number of CPUs. So
  if the number of CPUs is 4, the most you should expect is a 4x speedup.

- **Physical versus logical CPUs:** Do the machines you're running on have fewer
  **physical** cores than **logical** cores? You can check the number of logical
  cores with ``psutil.cpu_count()`` and the number of physical cores with
  ``psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)``. This is common on a lot of machines and
  especially on EC2. For many workloads (especially numerical workloads), you
  often cannot expect a greater speedup than the number of physical CPUs.

- **Small tasks:** Are your tasks very small? Ray introduces some overhead for
  each task (the amount of overhead depends on the arguments that are passed
  in). You will be unlikely to see speedups if your tasks take less than ten
  milliseconds. For many workloads, you can easily increase the sizes of your
  tasks by batching them together.

- **Variable durations:** Do your tasks have variable duration? If you run 10
  tasks with variable duration in parallel, you shouldn't expect an N-fold
  speedup (because you'll end up waiting for the slowest task). In this case,
  consider using ``ray.wait`` to begin processing tasks that finish first.

- **Multi-threaded libraries:** Are all of your tasks attempting to use all of
  the cores on the machine? If so, they are likely to experience contention and
  prevent your application from achieving a speedup.
  This is common with some versions of ``numpy``. To avoid contention, set an
  environment variable like ``MKL_NUM_THREADS`` (or the equivalent depending on
  your installation) to ``1``.

  For many - but not all - libraries, you can diagnose this by opening ``top``
  while your application is running. If one process is using most of the CPUs,
  and the others are using a small amount, this may be the problem. The most
  common exception is PyTorch, which will appear to be using all the cores
  despite needing ``torch.set_num_threads(1)`` to be called to avoid contention.

If you are still experiencing a slowdown, but none of the above problems apply,
we'd really like to know! Create a `GitHub issue`_ and Submit a minimal code example that demonstrates the problem.

.. _ray-core-timeline:

Visualizing Tasks with Ray Timeline
-------------------------------------
View :ref:`how to use Ray Timeline in the Dashboard <dashboard-timeline>` for more details.

Instead of using Dashboard UI to download the tracing file, you can also export the tracing file as a JSON file by running ``ray timeline`` from the command line or ``ray.timeline`` from the Python API.
.. code-block:: python
ray.timeline(filename="/tmp/timeline.json")


.. _dashboard-profiling:

Python CPU profiling in the Dashboard
-------------------------------------

The :ref:`Ray dashboard <observability-getting-started>`  lets you profile Ray worker processes by clicking on the "Stack Trace" or "CPU Flame Graph"
actions for active workers, actors, and jobs.

.. image:: /images/profile.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

Clicking "Stack Trace" returns the current stack trace sample using ``py-spy``. By default, only the Python stack
trace is shown. To show native code frames, set the URL parameter ``native=1`` (only supported on Linux).

.. image:: /images/stack.png
   :align: center
   :width: 60%

Clicking "CPU Flame Graph" takes a number of stack trace samples and combine them into a flame graph visualization.
This flame graph can be useful for understanding the CPU activity of the particular process. To adjust the duration
of the flame graph, you can change the ``duration`` parameter in the URL. Similarly, you can change the ``native``
parameter to enable native profiling.

.. image:: /images/flamegraph.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%

The profiling feature requires ``py-spy`` to be installed. If it is not installed, or if the ``py-spy`` binary does
not have root permissions, the Dashboard prompts with instructions on how to setup ``py-spy`` correctly:

.. code-block::

    This command requires `py-spy` to be installed with root permissions. You
    can install `py-spy` and give it root permissions as follows:
      $ pip install py-spy
      $ sudo chown root:root `which py-spy`
      $ sudo chmod u+s `which py-spy`

    Alternatively, you can start Ray with passwordless sudo / root permissions.

.. note::
   If you run Ray in a Docker container, you may run into permission errors when using py-spy. Follow the `py-spy documentation`_  to resolve it.
   
.. _`py-spy documentation`: https://github.com/benfred/py-spy#how-do-i-run-py-spy-in-docker



.. _dashboard-cprofile:

Profiling using Python's cProfile
---------------------------------

You can use Python's native cProfile `profiling module`_ to profile the performance of your Ray application. Rather than tracking
line-by-line of your application code, cProfile can give the total runtime
of each loop function, as well as list the number of calls made and
execution time of all function calls made within the profiled code.

.. _`profiling module`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile

Unlike ``line_profiler`` above, this detailed list of profiled function calls
**includes** internal function calls and function calls made within Ray.

However, similar to ``line_profiler``, cProfile can be enabled with minimal
changes to your application code (given that each section of the code you want
to profile is defined as its own function). To use cProfile, add an import
statement, then replace calls to the loop functions as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import cProfile  # Added import statement

  def ex1():
      list1 = []
      for i in range(5):
          list1.append(ray.get(func.remote()))

  def main():
      ray.init()
      cProfile.run('ex1()')  # Modified call to ex1
      cProfile.run('ex2()')
      cProfile.run('ex3()')

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()

Now, when you execute your Python script, a cProfile list of profiled function
calls are printed on the terminal for each call made to ``cProfile.run()``.
At the very top of cProfile's output gives the total execution time for
``'ex1()'``:

.. code-block:: bash

  601 function calls (595 primitive calls) in 2.509 seconds

Following is a snippet of profiled function calls for ``'ex1()'``. Most of
these calls are quick and take around 0.000 seconds, so the functions of
interest are the ones with non-zero execution times:

.. code-block:: bash

  ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
  ...
      1    0.000    0.000    2.509    2.509 your_script_here.py:31(ex1)
      5    0.000    0.000    0.001    0.000 remote_function.py:103(remote)
      5    0.000    0.000    0.001    0.000 remote_function.py:107(_remote)
  ...
     10    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 worker.py:2459(__init__)
      5    0.000    0.000    2.508    0.502 worker.py:2535(get)
      5    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 worker.py:2695(get_global_worker)
     10    0.000    0.000    2.507    0.251 worker.py:374(retrieve_and_deserialize)
      5    0.000    0.000    2.508    0.502 worker.py:424(get_object)
      5    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 worker.py:514(submit_task)
  ...

The 5 separate calls to Ray's ``get``, taking the full 0.502 seconds each call,
can be noticed at ``worker.py:2535(get)``. Meanwhile, the act of calling the
remote function itself at ``remote_function.py:103(remote)`` only takes 0.001
seconds over 5 calls, and thus is not the source of the slow performance of
``ex1()``.


Profiling Ray Actors with cProfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Considering that the detailed output of cProfile can be quite different depending
on what Ray functionalities we use, let us see what cProfile's output might look
like if our example involved Actors (for an introduction to Ray actors, see our
:ref:`Actor documentation <actor-guide>`).

Now, instead of looping over five calls to a remote function like in ``ex1``,
let's create a new example and loop over five calls to a remote function
**inside an actor**. Our actor's remote function again just sleeps for 0.5
seconds:

.. code-block:: python

  # Our actor
  @ray.remote
  class Sleeper(object):
      def __init__(self):
          self.sleepValue = 0.5

      # Equivalent to func(), but defined within an actor
      def actor_func(self):
          time.sleep(self.sleepValue)

Recalling the suboptimality of ``ex1``, let's first see what happens if we
attempt to perform all five ``actor_func()`` calls within a single actor:

.. code-block:: python

  def ex4():
      # This is suboptimal in Ray, and should only be used for the sake of this example
      actor_example = Sleeper.remote()

      five_results = []
      for i in range(5):
          five_results.append(actor_example.actor_func.remote())

      # Wait until the end to call ray.get()
      ray.get(five_results)

We enable cProfile on this example as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  def main():
      ray.init()
      cProfile.run('ex4()')

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()

Running our new Actor example, cProfile's abbreviated output is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  12519 function calls (11956 primitive calls) in 2.525 seconds

  ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
  ...
  1    0.000    0.000    0.015    0.015 actor.py:546(remote)
  1    0.000    0.000    0.015    0.015 actor.py:560(_remote)
  1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 actor.py:697(__init__)
  ...
  1    0.000    0.000    2.525    2.525 your_script_here.py:63(ex4)
  ...
  9    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 worker.py:2459(__init__)
  1    0.000    0.000    2.509    2.509 worker.py:2535(get)
  9    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 worker.py:2695(get_global_worker)
  4    0.000    0.000    2.508    0.627 worker.py:374(retrieve_and_deserialize)
  1    0.000    0.000    2.509    2.509 worker.py:424(get_object)
  8    0.000    0.000    0.001    0.000 worker.py:514(submit_task)
  ...

It turns out that the entire example still took 2.5 seconds to execute, or the
time for five calls to ``actor_func()`` to run in serial. If you recall ``ex1``,
this behavior was because we did not wait until after submitting all five
remote function tasks to call ``ray.get()``, but we can verify on cProfile's
output line ``worker.py:2535(get)`` that ``ray.get()`` was only called once at
the end, for 2.509 seconds. What happened?

It turns out Ray cannot parallelize this example, because we have only
initialized a single ``Sleeper`` actor. Because each actor is a single,
stateful worker, our entire code is submitted and ran on a single worker the
whole time.

To better parallelize the actors in ``ex4``, we can take advantage
that each call to ``actor_func()`` is independent, and instead
create five ``Sleeper`` actors. That way, we are creating five workers
that can run in parallel, instead of creating a single worker that
can only handle one call to ``actor_func()`` at a time.

.. code-block:: python

  def ex4():
      # Modified to create five separate Sleepers
      five_actors = [Sleeper.remote() for i in range(5)]

      # Each call to actor_func now goes to a different Sleeper
      five_results = []
      for actor_example in five_actors:
          five_results.append(actor_example.actor_func.remote())

      ray.get(five_results)

Our example in total now takes only 1.5 seconds to run:

.. code-block:: bash

  1378 function calls (1363 primitive calls) in 1.567 seconds

  ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
