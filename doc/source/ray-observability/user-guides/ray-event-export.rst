Ray Event Export
================

Starting from 2.49, Ray supports exporting structured events to a configured HTTP 
endpoint. Each node sends events to the endpoint through an HTTP POST request.

Ray 2.49 supports exporting task events. Future releases include support for other 
event types, such as actor events, node events, job events, and more.

Previously, Ray's :ref:`task events <task-events>` were only used internally by the Ray Dashboard 
and :ref:`State API <state-api-overview-ref>` for monitoring and debugging. With the new event 
export feature, you can now send these raw events to external systems for custom analytics, 
monitoring, and integration with third-party tools.

.. note:: 
    Ray Event Export is still in alpha. The way to configure event 
    reporting and the format of the events is subject to change.

Enable event reporting
----------------------
To enable event reporting, you need to set the ``RAY_enable_core_worker_ray_event_to_aggregator`` environment 
variable to ``1`` when starting each Ray worker node.

To set the target HTTP endpoint, set the ``RAY_events_export_addr`` 
environment variable to a valid HTTP URL with the ``http://`` URL scheme.

Event format
------------

Events are JSON objects in the POST request body.

All events contain the same base fields and different event specific fields. 
See `src/ray/protobuf/public/events_base_event.proto <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/src/ray/protobuf/public/events_base_event.proto>`_ for the base fields.

Task events
^^^^^^^^^^^

For each task, Ray exports two types of events: Task Definition Event and Task Execution Event.

* Each task attempt generates one Task Definition Event which contains the metadata of the task. 
  See `src/ray/protobuf/public/events_task_definition_event.proto <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/src/ray/protobuf/public/events_task_definition_event.proto>`_ 
  and `src/ray/protobuf/public/events_actor_task_definition_event.proto <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/src/ray/protobuf/public/events_actor_task_definition_event.proto>`_ for the event formats for normal tasks 
  and actor tasks respectively.
* Task Execution Events contain task state transition information and metadata 
  generated during task execution. 
  See `src/ray/protobuf/public/events_task_execution_event.proto <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/src/ray/protobuf/public/events_task_execution_event.proto>`_ for the event format.

High-level Architecture
-----------------------

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of Ray Event Export.

.. image:: ../images/ray-event-export.png

All Ray components send events to an aggregator agent through gRPC. There is an aggregator
agent on each node. The aggregator agent collects all events on that node and sends the
events to the configured HTTP endpoint.
