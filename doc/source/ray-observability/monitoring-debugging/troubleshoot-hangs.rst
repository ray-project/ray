Troubleshooting Hangs
=====================

Observing Ray Work
------------------

You can run ``ray stack`` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on
the current node. This requires ``py-spy`` to be installed. See the `Troubleshooting page <troubleshooting.html>`_ for more details.

This document discusses some common problems that people run into when using Ray
as well as some known problems. If you encounter other problems, please
`let us know`_.
