RLlib's callback APIs
=====================

RLlib's callbacks are the easiest way for you to inject code into your experiments.

In a nutshell, you define the code you want to execute at certain events and pass it to your
:py:class:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm_config.AlgorithmConfig`.

Here is an example of defining a simple lambda that prints out an episode's return after
the episode has terminated:

.. testcode::

    from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig

    ppo = config = (
        PPOConfig()
        .environment("CartPole-v1")
        .callbacks(
            on_episode_end=(
                lambda episode, **kw: print(f"Episode done. R={episode.get_return()}")
            )
        )
        .build()
    )
    ppo.train()

.. testcode::
    :hide:

    ppo.stop()


Callback lambdas vs stateful RLlibCallback
------------------------------------------
There are two ways to define custom code and have it executed during the various callback events.

Callback lambdas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your injected code is rather simple and doesn't need to store temporary information
for reuse in succeeding event calls, you can use a lambda
and pass it to the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm_config.AlgorithmConfig.callbacks`
method as previously shown.

See here for a :ref:`complete list of supported callback events <rllib-callback-event-overview>`.
The names of the events always match the argument names for the
:py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm_config.AlgorithmConfig.callbacks` method.


Stateful RLlibCallback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you need your code to be stateful and be able to temporarily store results for reuse
in succeeding calls triggered by the same or a different event, you
need to subclass the :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback` API and then implement
one or more methods, for example :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback.on_algorithm_init`:

Here is the same example, printing out a terminated episode's return, but using
a subclass of :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback`.

.. testcode::

    from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig
    from ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks import RLlibCallback

    class EpisodeReturn(RLlibCallback):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            # Keep some global state in between individual callback events.
            self.overall_sum_of_rewards = 0.0

        def on_episode_end(self, *, episode, **kwargs):
            self.overall_sum_of_rewards += episode.get_return()
            print(f"Episode done. R={episode.get_return()} Global SUM={self.overall_sum_of_rewards}")

    ppo = (
        PPOConfig()
        .environment("CartPole-v1")
        .callbacks(EpisodeReturn)
        .build()
    )
    ppo.train()

.. testcode::
    :hide:

    ppo.stop()


.. _rllib-callback-event-overview:

Overview of all callback events
-------------------------------

During a training iteration, the Algorithm normally walks through the following event tree. Note
that some of the events in the tree happen simultaneously, on different processes through Ray actors.
For example an EnvRunner actor may trigger its ``on_episode_start`` event while at the same time another
EnvRunner actor may trigger its ``on_sample_end`` event and the main Algorithm process triggers
``on_train_result``.

.. note::

    Currently, RLlib only invokes callbacks in :py:class:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm.Algorithm`
    and :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner.EnvRunner` actors.
    The Ray team is considering expanding callbacks onto :py:class:`~ray.rllib.core.learner.learner.Learner`
    actors and possibly :py:class:`~ray.rllib.core.rl_module.rl_module.RLModule` instances as well.


Here is a high-level overview of all supported events in RLlib's callbacks system.

.. code-block:: text

    Algorithm
        .__init__()
            `on_algorithm_init` - After algorithm construction and setup.
        .train()
            `on_train_result` - After a training iteration.
        .evaluate()
            `on_evaluate_start` - Before evaluation starts using the eval ``EnvRunnerGroup``.
            `on_evaluate_end` - After evaluation is finished.
        .restore_from_path()
            `on_checkpoint_loaded` - After a checkpoint's new state has been loaded.

    EnvRunner
        .__init__()
            `on_environment_created` - After the RL environment has been created.
        .sample()
            `on_episode_created` - After a new episode object has been created.
            `on_episode_start` - After an episode object has started (after ``env.reset()``).
            `on_episode_step` - After an episode object has stepped (after ``env.step()``).
            `on_episode_end` - After an episode object has terminated (or truncated).
            `on_sample_end` - At the end of the ``EnvRunner.sample()`` call.

Chaining callbacks
------------------

You can define more than one :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback` class and send them in a list to the
:py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm_config.AlgorithmConfig.callbacks` method.
You can also send lists of callables, instead of a single callable, to the different
arguments of that method.

For example, assume you already have a subclass of :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback`
written and would like to reuse it in different experiments. However, one of your experiments
requires some debug callback code you would like to inject only temporarily for a couple of runs.

Resolution order of chained callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLlib resolves all available callback methods and callables for a given event
as follows:

Subclasses of :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback` take precedence
over individual or lists of callables provided through the various arguments of
the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm_config.AlgorithmConfig.callbacks` method.

For example, assume the callback event is ``on_train_result``, which fires at the end of
a training iteration and inside the algorithm's process.

- RLlib loops through the list of all given :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback`
  subclasses and calls their ``on_train_result`` method. Thereby, it keeps the exact order the user
  provided in the list.
- RLlib then loops through the list of all defined ``on_train_result`` callables. The user configured these
  by calling the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm_config.AlgorithmConfig.callbacks` method
  and defining the ``on_train_result`` argument in this call.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyCallbacks(RLlibCallback):
        def on_train_result(self, *, algorithm, metrics_logger, result, **kwargs):
            print("RLlibCallback subclass")

    class MyDebugCallbacks(RLlibCallback):
        def on_train_result(self, *, algorithm, metrics_logger, result, **kwargs):
            print("debug subclass")

    # Define the callbacks order through the config.
    # Subclasses first, then individual `on_train_result` (or other events) callables:
    config.callbacks(
        callbacks_class=[MyDebugCallbacks, MyCallbacks],  # <- note: debug class first
        on_train_result=[
            lambda algorithm, **kw: print('lambda 1'),
            lambda algorithm, **kw: print('lambda 2'),
        ],
    )

    # When training the algorithm, after each training iteration, you should see
    # something like:
    # > debug subclass
    # > RLlibCallback subclass
    # > lambda 1
    # > lambda 2


Examples
--------

Here are two examples showing you how to setup custom callbacks on the
:ref:`Algorithm <rllib-key-concepts-algorithms>` process as well as on the
:ref:`EnvRunner <rllib-key-concepts-env-runners>` processes.


Example 1: `on_train_result`
----------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to implement a simple custom function writing the replay buffer
contents to disk from time to time.

You normally don't want to write the contents of buffers along with your
:ref:`Algorithm checkpoints <rllib-checkpoints-docs>`, so doing this less often, in a more
controlled fashion through a custom callback could be a good compromise.

.. testcode::

    import ormsgpack
    from ray.rllib.algorithms.dqn import DQNConfig

    def _write_buffer_if_necessary(algorithm, metrics_logger, result):
        # Write the buffer contents only every ith iteration.
        if algorithm.training_iteration % 2 == 0:
            # python dict
            buffer_contents = algorithm.local_replay_buffer.get_state()

            # binary
            msgpacked = ormsgpack.packb(
               buffer_contents,
               option=ormsgpack.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY,
            )

            # Open some file and write the buffer contents into it using `ormsgpack`.
            with open("replay_buffer_contents.msgpack", "wb") as f:
               f.write(msgpacked)

    config = (
        DQNConfig()
        .environment("CartPole-v1")
        .callbacks(
           on_train_result=_write_buffer_if_necessary,
        )
    )
    dqn = config.build()

    # Train n times. Expect buffer to be written every ith iteration.
    for _ in range(4):
        print(dqn.train())

.. tip::
   See :ref:`here for the exact call signatures and expected argument types <rllib-callback-reference-algorithm-bound>`
   of all available callbacks.


Example 2: `on_episode_step` and `on_episode_end`
-------------------------------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to implement a custom :py:class:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback` class
computing the average "first-joint angle" of the
`Acrobot-v1 RL environment <https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/envs/classic_control/acrobot.py>`__.

.. figure:: images/acrobot-v1.png
    :width: 150
    :align: left

    **The Acrobot-v1 environment**: The env's code described the angle you are about to
    compute and log through your custom callback as:

    .. code-block:: text

        `theta1` is the angle of the first joint, where an angle of 0.0 indicates that the first
        link is pointing directly downwards.

The example utilizes RLlib's :py:class:`~ray.rllib.utils.metrics.metrics_logger.MetricsLogger`
API to log the custom computations happening in the injected code your Algorithm's main results system.

.. todo: uncomment this once metrics-logger.rst page is online.

Also take a look at this more complex example on `how to generate and log a PacMan heatmap (image) to WandB <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/metrics/custom_metrics_in_env_runners.py>`__.

.. testcode::

    import math
    import numpy as np
    from ray.rllib.algorithms.ppo import PPOConfig
    from ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks import RLlibCallback

    class LogAcrobotAngle(RLlibCallback):
        def on_episode_step(self, *, episode, env, **kwargs):
            # First get the angle from the env (note that `env` is a VectorEnv).
            # See https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/envs/classic_control/acrobot.py
            # for the env's source code.
            cos_theta1, sin_theta1 = env.envs[0].unwrapped.state[0], env.envs[0].unwrapped.state[1]
            # Convert cos/sin/tan into degree.
            deg_theta1 = math.degrees(math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1))

            # Log the theta1 degree value in the episode object, temporarily.
            episode.add_temporary_timestep_data("theta1", deg_theta1)

        def on_episode_end(self, *, episode, metrics_logger, **kwargs):
            # Get all the logged theta1 degree values and average them.
            theta1s = episode.get_temporary_timestep_data("theta1")
            avg_theta1 = np.mean(theta1s)

            # Log the final result - per episode - to the MetricsLogger.
            # Report with a sliding/smoothing window of 50.
            metrics_logger.log_value("theta1_mean", avg_theta1, reduce="mean", window=50)

    config = (
        PPOConfig()
        .environment("Acrobot-v1")
        .callbacks(
            callbacks_class=LogAcrobotAngle,
        )
    )
    ppo = config.build()

    # Train n times. Expect `theta1_mean` to be found in the results under:
    # `env_runners/theta1_mean`
    for i in range(10):
        results = ppo.train()
        print(
            f"iter={i} "
            f"theta1_mean={results['env_runners']['theta1_mean']} "
            f"R={results['env_runners']['episode_return_mean']}"
        )

.. tip::
    You can base your custom logic on whether the calling EnvRunner is a regular "training"
    EnvRunner, used to collect training samples, or an evaluation EnvRunner, used to play
    through episodes for evaluation only.
    Access the ``env_runner.config.in_evaluation`` boolean flag, which is True on
    evaluation ``EnvRunner`` actors and False on ``EnvRunner`` actors used to collect
    training data.

.. tip::
    See :ref:`here for the exact call signatures and expected argument types <rllib-callback-reference-algorithm-bound>`
    of all available callbacks.
