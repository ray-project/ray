Examples
========

This page contains an index of all the python scripts in the
`examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__
of RLlib, demonstrating the different use cases and features of the library.

.. note::

    RLlib is currently in a transition state from "old API stack" to "new API stack".
    Some of the examples here haven't been translated yet to the new stack and are tagged
    with the following comment line on top: ``# @OldAPIStack``. The moving of all example
    scripts over to the "new API stack" is work in progress and expected to be completed
    by the end of 2024.

.. note::

    If any new-API-stack example is broken, or if you'd like to add an example to this page,
    feel free to raise an issue on `RLlib's github repository <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/new/choose>`__.


Folder Structure
++++++++++++++++
The `examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__ is
structured into several sub-directories, the contents of all of which are described in detail below.


How to run an example script
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most of the example scripts are self-executable, meaning you can just ``cd`` into the respective
directory and run the script as-is with python:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ray/rllib/examples/multi_agent
    $ python multi_agent_pendulum.py --enable-new-api-stack --num-agents=2


Use the `--help` command line argument to have each script print out its supported command line options.

Most of the scripts share a common subset of generally applicable command line arguments,
for example `--num-env-runners`, `--no-tune`, or `--wandb-key`.

Algorithms
----------

- `How to write a custom Algorith.training_step() method combining on- and off-policy training <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/algorithms/custom_training_step_on_and_off_policy_combined.py>`__:
   Example of how to override the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm.Algorithm.training_step` method
   to train two different policies in parallel (also using multi-agent API).

Checkpoints
-----------

- `How to extract a checkpoint from n Tune trials using one or more custom criteria. <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/checkpoints/checkpoint_by_custom_criteria.py>`__:
   Example of how to find a :ref:`checkpoint <rllib-saving-and-loading-algos-and-policies-docs>` after a `Tuner.fit()` with some custom defined criteria.

Connectors
----------

.. note::
    RLlib's Connector API has been re-written from scratch for the new API stack.
    Connector-pieces and -pipelines are now referred to as :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2`
    (as opposed to ``Connector``, which only continue to work on the old API stack).


- `How to frame-stack Atari image observations <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/frame_stacking.py>`__:
   An example using Atari framestacking in a very efficient manner, not in the environment itself (as a `gym.Wrapper`),
   but by stacking the observations on-the-fly using `EnvToModule` and `LearnerConnector` pipelines.
   This method of framestacking is more efficient as it avoids having to send large observation
   tensors through the network (ray).

- `How to mean/std-filter observations <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/mean_std_filtering.py>`__:
   An example of a :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2` that filters all observations from the environment using a
   plain mean/std-filter (shift by the mean and divide by std-dev). This example demonstrates
   how a stateful :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2` class has its states
   (here the means and standard deviations of the individual observation items) coming from the different
   :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner.EnvRunner` instances a) merged into one common state and
   then b) broadcast again back to the remote :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner.EnvRunner` workers.

- `How to include previous-actions and/or previous rewards in RLModule inputs <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/prev_actions_prev_rewards.py>`__:
   An example of a :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2` that adds the n previous actions
   and/or the m previous rewards to the RLModule's input dict (to perform its forward passes, both
   for inference and training).

- `How to train with nested action spaces <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/nested_action_spaces.py>`__:
   Learning in arbitrarily nested action spaces, using an env in which the action space equals the
   observation space (both are complex, nested Dicts) and the policy has to pick actions
   that closely match (or are identical) to the previously seen observations.

- `How to train with nested observation spaces <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/nested_observation_spaces.py>`__:
   Learning in arbitrarily nested observation spaces
   (using a CartPole-v1 variant with a nested Dict observation space).

    and thus help the learning algorithm to cope with an otherwise unsolvable task.
    Also see the :doc:`curriculum learning how-to </rllib/rllib-advanced-api>` from the documentation.

   Example showing how you can render and record episode trajectories of your gymnasium envs and log the videos to WandB.

Evaluation
----------

- `How to run evaluation with a custom evaluation function <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/evaluation/custom_evaluation.py>`__:
   Example of how to write a custom evaluation function that's called instead of the default behavior, which is running with the evaluation worker set through n episodes.

- `How to run evaluation in parallel to training <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/evaluation/evaluation_parallel_to_training.py>`__:
   Example showing how the evaluation workers and the "normal" rollout workers can run (to some extend) in parallel to speed up training.

GPU (for Training and Sampling)
-------------------------------

- `How to use fractional GPUs for training an RLModule <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/gpus/fractional_gpus_per_learner.py>`__:
   If your model is small and easily fits on a single GPU and you want to therefore train
   other models alongside it to save time and cost, this script shows you how to set up
   your RLlib config with a fractional number of GPUs on the learner (model training)

Tuned Examples
++++++++++++++

The `tuned examples <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/tuned_examples>`__ folder
contains python config files (yaml for the old API stack) that can be executed analogously to
all other example scripts described here in order to run tuned learning experiments
for the different algorithms and different environment types.

For example, see this tuned Atari example for PPO, which learns to solve the Pong environment
in roughly 5min. It can be run like this on a single g5.24xlarge (or g6.24xlarge) machine with
4 GPUs and 96 CPUs:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ray/rllib/tuned_examples/ppo
    $ python atari_ppo.py --env ALE/Pong-v5 --num-gpus=4 --num-env-runners=95

Note that some of the files in this folder are used for RLlib's daily or weekly
release tests as well.
