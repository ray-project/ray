Examples
========

This page contains an index of all the python scripts in the
`examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__
of RLlib, demonstrating the different use cases and features of the library.

.. note::

    RLlib is currently in a transition state from old- to new API stack.
    The Ray team has translated most of the example scripts to the new stack and tag those
    still on the old stack with this comment line on top: ``# @OldAPIStack``.
    The moving of all example scripts over to the new stack is work in progress.

.. note::

    If you find any new API stack example broken, or if you'd like to add an example to this page,
    create an issue in the `RLlib GitHub repository <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/new/choose>`__.


Folder structure
----------------
The `examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__ has
several sub-directories described in detail below.


How to run an example script
----------------------------

Most of the example scripts are self-executable, meaning you can ``cd`` into the respective
directory and run the script as-is with python:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ray/rllib/examples/multi_agent
    $ python multi_agent_pendulum.py --enable-new-api-stack --num-agents=2


Use the `--help` command line argument to have each script print out its supported command line options.

Most of the scripts share a common subset of generally applicable command line arguments,
for example `--num-env-runners`, to scale the number of EnvRunner actors, `--no-tune`, to switch off running with Ray Tune,
`--wandb-key`, to log to WandB, or `--verbose`, to control log chattiness.


All example sub-folders
-----------------------


Actions

   to resume training.


Connectors
++++++++++

.. note::
    RLlib's Connector API has been re-written from scratch for the new API stack.
    Connector-pieces and -pipelines are now referred to as :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2`
    to distinguish against the ``Connector`` class, which only continue to work on the old API stack.


- `Flatten and one-hot observations <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/flatten_observations_dict_space.py>`__:
   Demonstrates how to one-hot discrete observation spaces and/or flatten complex observations, Dict or Tuple, allowing RLlib to process arbitrary
   observation data as flattened 1D vectors. Useful for environments with complex, discrete, or hierarchical observations.

- `Observation frame-stacking <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/frame_stacking.py>`__:
   Implements frame stacking, where N consecutive frames stack together to provide temporal context to the agent.
   This technique is common in environments with continuous state changes, like video frames in Atari games.
   Using connectors for frame stacking is more efficient as it avoids having to send large observation tensors through
   ray remote calls.

- `Mean/Std filtering <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/mean_std_filtering.py>`__:
   Adds mean and standard deviation normalization for observations, shifting by the mean and dividing by std-dev.
   This type of filtering can improve learning stability in environments with highly variable state magnitudes
   by scaling observations to a normalized range.

- `Prev-actions, prev-rewards connector <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/prev_actions_prev_rewards.py>`__:
   Augments observations with previous actions and rewards, giving the agent a short-term memory of past events, which can improve

   Using curiosity is beneficial in sparse-reward environments where agents may struggle to find rewarding paths.
   However, count-based methods are only feasible for environments with small observation spaces.

- `Euclidian distance-based curiosity <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curiosity/euclidian_distance_based_curiosity.py>`__:
   Uses Euclidean distance between states and the initial state to measure novelty, encouraging exploration by rewarding the agent for reaching "far away"
   regions of the environment.
   Suitable for sparse-reward tasks, where diverse exploration is key to success.

- `Intrinsic-curiosity-model (ICM) Based Curiosity <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curiosity/intrinsic_curiosity_model_based_curiosity.py>`__:
   Adds an `Intrinsic Curiosity Model (ICM) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf>`__ that learns to predict the next state as well as the action in
   between two states to measure novelty. The higher the loss of the ICM, the higher the "novelty" and thus the intrinsic reward.
