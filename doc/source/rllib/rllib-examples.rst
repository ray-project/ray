Examples
========

This page contains an index of all the python scripts in the
`examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__
of RLlib, demonstrating the different use cases and features of the library.

.. note::

    RLlib is currently in a transition state from "old API stack" to "new API stack".
    Some of the examples here haven't been translated yet to the new stack and are tagged
    with the following comment line on top: ``# @OldAPIStack``. The moving of all example
    scripts over to the "new API stack" is work in progress and expected to be completed
    by the end of 2024.

.. note::

    If any new-API-stack example is broken, or if you'd like to add an example to this page,
    feel free to raise an issue on `RLlib's github repository <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/new/choose>`__.


Folder Structure
++++++++++++++++
The `examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__ is
structured into several sub-directories, the contents of all of which are described in detail below.


How to run an example script
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most of the example scripts are self-executable, meaning you can just ``cd`` into the respective
directory and run the script as-is with python:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ray/rllib/examples/multi_agent
    $ python multi_agent_pendulum.py --enable-new-api-stack --num-agents=2


Use the `--help` command line argument to have each script print out its supported command line options.

Most of the scripts share a common subset of generally applicable command line arguments,
for example `--num-env-runners`, `--no-tune`, or `--wandb-key`.


All sub-folders
+++++++++++++++


Algorithms
----------

- |new_stack| `How to write a custom Algorith.training_step() method combining on- and off-policy training <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/algorithms/custom_training_step_on_and_off_policy_combined.py>`__:
   Example of how to override the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm.training_step` method of the
   :py:class:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.algorithm.Algorithm` class to train two different policies in parallel
   (also using multi-agent API).

Checkpoints
-----------

- |new_stack| `How to extract a checkpoint from n Tune trials using one or more custom criteria. <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/checkpoints/checkpoint_by_custom_criteria.py>`__:
   Example of how to find a :ref:`checkpoint <rllib-saving-and-loading-algos-and-policies-docs>` after a `Tuner.fit()` with some custom defined criteria.

Connectors
----------

.. note::
    RLlib's Connector API has been re-written from scratch for the new API stack (|new_stack|).
    Connector-pieces and -pipelines are now referred to as :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2`
    (as opposed to ``Connector``, which only continue to work on the old API stack |old_stack|).


- |new_stack| `How to frame-stack Atari image observations <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/frame_stacking.py>`__:
   An example using Atari framestacking in a very efficient manner, not in the environment itself (as a `gym.Wrapper`),
   but by stacking the observations on-the-fly using `EnvToModule` and `LearnerConnector` pipelines.
   This method of framestacking is more efficient as it avoids having to send large observation
   tensors through the network (ray).

   plain mean/std-filter (shift by the mean and divide by std-dev). This example demonstrates
   how a stateful :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2` class has its states
   (here the means and standard deviations of the individual observation items) coming from the different
   :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner.EnvRunner` instances a) merged into one common state and
   then b) broadcast again back to the remote :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner.EnvRunner` workers.

- |new_stack| `How to include previous-actions and/or previous rewards in RLModule inputs <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/prev_actions_prev_rewards.py>`__:

   and/or the m previous rewards to the RLModule's input dict (to perform its forward passes, both
   for inference and training).

- |new_stack| `How to train with nested action spaces <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/nested_action_spaces.py>`__:
   Learning in arbitrarily nested action spaces, using an env in which the action space equals the
   observation space (both are complex, nested Dicts) and the policy has to pick actions
   that closely match (or are identical) to the previously seen observations.

- |new_stack| `How to train with nested observation spaces <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/nested_observation_spaces.py>`__:

    Example of how to make the environment go through different levels of difficulty (from easy to harder to solve)
    and thus help the learning algorithm to cope with an otherwise unsolvable task.
    Also see the :doc:`curriculum learning how-to </rllib/rllib-advanced-api>` from the documentation.

Debugging
---------

- |old_stack| `How to run a Unity3D multi-agent environment locally <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib/examples/envs/external_envs/unity3d_env_local.py>`__:
   Example of how to setup an RLlib Algorithm against a locally running Unity3D editor instance to
   learn any Unity3D game (including support for multi-agent).
   Use this example to try things out and watch the game and the learning progress live in the editor.
   Providing a compiled game, this example could also run in distributed fashion with `num_env_runners > 0`.
   For a more heavy-weight, distributed, cloud-based example, see ``Unity3D client/server`` below.

   clients against a central RLlib Policy server learning how to play the game.
   The n distributed clients could themselves be servers for external/human players and allow for control
   being fully in the hands of the Unity entities instead of RLlib.

Tuned Examples
++++++++++++++

The `tuned examples <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/tuned_examples>`__ folder
contains python config files (yaml for the old API stack) that can be executed analogously to
all other example scripts described here in order to run tuned learning experiments
for the different algorithms and different environment types.

For example, see this tuned Atari example for PPO, which learns to solve the Pong environment
in roughly 5min. It can be run like this on a single g5.24xlarge (or g6.24xlarge) machine with
4 GPUs and 96 CPUs:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ray/rllib/tuned_examples/ppo
    $ python atari_ppo.py --env ALE/Pong-v5 --num-gpus=4 --num-env-runners=95

Note that some of the files in this folder are used for RLlib's daily or weekly
release tests as well.
