Examples
========

This page contains an index of all the python scripts in the
`examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__
of RLlib, demonstrating the different use cases and features of the library.

.. note::

    RLlib is currently in a transition state from old- to new API stack.
    Some of the example scripts haven't been translated yet to the new stack and are tagged
    with the following comment line on top: ``# @OldAPIStack``. The moving of all example
    scripts over to the new stack is work in progress.

.. note::

    If any (new API stack) example is broken, or if you'd like to add an example to this page,
    feel free to raise an issue on `RLlib's github repository <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/new/choose>`__.


Folder Structure
----------------
The `examples folder <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples>`__ is
structured into several sub-directories, the contents of all of which are described in detail below.


How to run an example script
----------------------------

Most of the example scripts are self-executable, meaning you can ``cd`` into the respective
directory and run the script as-is with python:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ray/rllib/examples/multi_agent
    $ python multi_agent_pendulum.py --enable-new-api-stack --num-agents=2


Use the `--help` command line argument to have each script print out its supported command line options.

Most of the scripts share a common subset of generally applicable command line arguments,
for example `--num-env-runners` (to scale the number of EnvRunner actors), `--no-tune` (to switch off running with Ray Tune),
`--wandb-key` (to log to W&B), or `--verbose` (to control log chattiness).


All example sub-folders
-----------------------


Actions
+++++++
- `Nested Action Spaces <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/actions/nested_action_spaces.py>`__:
   Sets up an environment with nested action spaces using custom (single- or multi-agent) configurations. This example demonstrates
   how RLlib manages complex action structures, such as multi-dimensional or hierarchical action spaces.


Checkpoints
+++++++++++

- `Checkpoint by Custom Criteria <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/checkpoints/checkpoint_by_custom_criteria.py>`__:
   Shows how to create checkpoints based on custom criteria, giving users control over when to save model snapshots during training.

- `Continue Training From Checkpoint <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/checkpoints/continue_training_from_checkpoint.py>`__:
   Illustrates resuming training from a saved checkpoint, useful for extending training sessions or recovering from interruptions.

- `Restore 1 (out of N) Agents from Checkpoint <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/checkpoints/restore_1_of_n_agents_from_checkpoint.py>`__:
   Restores one specific agent from a multi-agent checkpoint, allowing selective loading for environments where only certain agents need
   to resume training.


Connectors
++++++++++

.. note::
    RLlib's Connector API has been re-written from scratch for the new API stack.
    Connector-pieces and -pipelines are now referred to as :py:class:`~ray.rllib.connectors.connector_v2.ConnectorV2`
    (as opposed to ``Connector``, which only continue to work on the old API stack).


- `Flatten and One-Hot Observations <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/flatten_observations_dict_space.py>`__:
   Demonstrates how to one-hot discrete observation spaces and/or flatten complex observations (Dict or Tuple), allowing RLlib to process arbitrary
   observation data as flattened (1D) vectors. Useful for environments with complex, discrete, or hierarchical observations.

- `Observation Frame-Stacking <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/frame_stacking.py>`__:
   Implements frame stacking, where consecutive frames are stacked together to provide temporal context to the agent.
   This technique is common in environments with continuous state changes, like video frames in Atari games.
   Using connectors for frame stacking is more efficient as it avoids having to send large observation tensors through the network (ray).

- `Mean/Std Filtering <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/mean_std_filtering.py>`__:
   Adds mean and standard deviation normalization for observations (shift by the mean and divide by std-dev), improving learning stability
   by scaling observations to a normalized range. This can enhance performance in environments with highly variable state magnitudes.

- `Prev-Actions, Prev-Rewards Connector <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/connectors/prev_actions_prev_rewards.py>`__:
   Augments observations with previous actions and rewards, giving the agent a short-term memory of past events, which can improve
   decision-making in partially observable or sequentially dependent tasks.


Curiosity
+++++++++

- `Count-Based Curiosity <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curiosity/count_based_curiosity.py>`__:
   Implements count-based intrinsic motivation to encourage exploration of less visited states.
   Using curiosity is beneficial in sparse-reward environments where agents may struggle to find rewarding paths.
   However, count-based methods are only feasible for environments with small observation spaces.

- `Euclidian Distance-Based Curiosity <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curiosity/euclidian_distance_based_curiosity.py>`__:
   Uses Euclidean distance between states and the initial state to measure novelty, encouraging exploration by rewarding the agent for reaching "far away"
   regions of the environment.
   Suitable for sparse-reward tasks, where diverse exploration is key to success.

- `Intrinsic-Curiosity-Model (ICM) Based Curiosity <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curiosity/intrinsic_curiosity_model_based_curiosity.py>`__:
   Adds an `Intrinsic Curiosity Model (ICM) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05363.pdf>`__ that learns to predict the next state as well as the action in
   between two states to measure novelty. The higher the loss of the ICM, the higher the "novelty" and thus the intrinsic reward.
   Ideal for complex environments with large observation spaces where reward signals are sparse.


Curriculum Learning
+++++++++++++++++++

- `Custom Env Rendering Method <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curriculum/curriculum_learning.py>`__:

all other example scripts described here to run tuned learning experiments
for the different algorithms and environment types.
