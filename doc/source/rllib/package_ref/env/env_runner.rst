Single-agent and multi-agent EnvRunners
---------------------------------------

By default, RLlib uses two built-in subclasses of EnvRunner, one for :ref:`single-agent <single-agent-env-runner-reference-docs>`, one
for :ref:`multi-agent <multi-agent-env-runner-reference-docs>` setups. It determines based on your config, which one to use.

Check your ``config.is_multi_agent`` property to find out, which of these setups you have configured
and see :ref:`the docs on setting up RLlib multi-agent <rllib-multi-agent-environments-doc>` for more details.
