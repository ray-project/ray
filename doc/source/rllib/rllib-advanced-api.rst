Advanced Python APIs
--------------------

Custom Training Workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `basic training example <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/envs/custom_gym_env.py>`__,
Tune will call ``train()`` on your algorithm once per training iteration and report
the new training results.
Sometimes, it's desirable to have full control over training, but still run inside Tune.
Tune supports :ref:`custom trainable functions <trainable-docs>` that can be used to
implement `custom training workflows (example) <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/ray_tune/custom_train_function.py>`__.

Curriculum Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In curriculum learning, you can set the environment to different difficulties
throughout the training process. This setting allows the algorithm to learn how to solve
the actual and final problem incrementally, by interacting with and exploring in more and
more difficult phases.
Normally, such a curriculum starts with setting the environment to an easy level and
then - as training progresses - transitions more toward a harder-to-solve difficulty.
See the `Reverse Curriculum Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents <https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/12/20/reverse-curriculum/>`_ blog post
for another example of how you can do curriculum learning.

RLlib's Algorithm and custom callbacks APIs allow for implementing any arbitrary
curricula. This `example script <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curriculum/curriculum_learning.py>`__ introduces
the basic concepts you need to understand.

First, define some env options. This example uses the `FrozenLake-v1` environment,
a grid world, whose map is fully customizable.  Three tasks of different env difficulties
are represented by slightly different maps that the agent has to navigate.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../rllib/examples/curriculum/curriculum_learning.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __curriculum_learning_example_env_options__
   :end-before: __END_curriculum_learning_example_env_options__

Then, define the central piece controlling the curriculum, which is a custom callbacks class
overriding the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.callbacks.DefaultCallbacks.on_train_result`.


.. TODO move to doc_code and make it use algo configs.
.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray import tune
    from ray.rllib.agents.callbacks import DefaultCallbacks

    class MyCallbacks(DefaultCallbacks):
        def on_train_result(self, algorithm, result, **kwargs):
            if result["env_runners"]["episode_return_mean"] > 200:
                task = 2
            elif result["env_runners"]["episode_return_mean"] > 100:
                task = 1
            else:
                task = 0
            algorithm.workers.foreach_worker(
                lambda ev: ev.foreach_env(
                    lambda env: env.set_task(task)))

    ray.init()
    tune.Tuner(
        "PPO",
        param_space={
            "env": YourEnv,
            "callbacks": MyCallbacks,
        },
    ).fit()


Global Coordination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes, it's necessary to coordinate between pieces of code that live in different
processes managed by RLlib.
For example, it can be useful to maintain a global average of a certain variable,
or centrally control a hyperparameter used by policies.
Ray provides a general way to achieve this through *named actors*
(learn more about :ref:`Ray actors here <actor-guide>`).
These actors are assigned a global name and handles to them can be retrieved using
these names. As an example, consider maintaining a shared global counter that's
incremented by environments and read periodically from your driver program:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_counter_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_counter_end__

Ray actors provide high levels of performance, so in more complex cases they can be
used implement communication patterns such as parameter servers and all-reduce.

Callbacks and Custom Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide callbacks to be called at points during policy evaluation.
These callbacks have access to state for the current
`episode <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/evaluation/episode.py>`__.
Certain callbacks such as ``on_postprocess_trajectory``, ``on_sample_end``,
and ``on_train_result`` are also places where custom postprocessing can be applied to
intermediate data or results.

User-defined state can be stored for the
`episode <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/evaluation/episode.py>`__
in the ``episode.user_data`` dict, and custom scalar metrics reported by saving values
to the ``episode.custom_metrics`` dict. These custom metrics are aggregated and
reported as part of training results. For a full example, take a look at
`this example script here <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/custom_metrics_and_callbacks.py>`__
and
`these unit test cases here <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/algorithms/tests/test_callbacks_old_stack.py>`__.

.. tip::
    You can create custom logic that can run on each evaluation episode by checking
    if the :py:class:`~ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker.RolloutWorker` is in
    evaluation mode, through accessing ``worker.policy_config["in_evaluation"]``.
    You can then implement this check in ``on_episode_start()`` or ``on_episode_end()``
    in your subclass of :py:class:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.callbacks.DefaultCallbacks`.
    For running callbacks before and after the evaluation
    runs in whole we provide ``on_evaluate_start()`` and ``on_evaluate_end``.

Chaining Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :py:func:`~ray.rllib.algorithms.callbacks.make_multi_callbacks` utility to chain
multiple callbacks together.

Visualizing Custom Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom metrics can be accessed and visualized like any other training result:

.. _exploration-api:

Customizing Exploration Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLlib offers a unified top-level API to configure and customize an agent’s
exploration behavior, including the decisions (how and whether) to sample
actions from distributions (stochastically or deterministically).
The setup can be done using built-in Exploration classes
(see `this package <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/utils/exploration/>`__),
which are specified (and further configured) inside
``AlgorithmConfig().env_runners(..)``.
Besides using one of the available classes, one can sub-class any of
these built-ins, add custom behavior to it, and use that new class in
the config instead.

Every policy has-an Exploration object, which is created from the AlgorithmConfig’s
``.env_runners(exploration_config=...)`` method, which specifies the class to use through the
special “type” key, as well as constructor arguments through all other keys,
e.g.:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_explore_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_explore_end__

The following table lists all built-in Exploration sub-classes and the agents
that currently use these by default:

.. View table below at: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dEMhosbu7HVgHEwGBuMlEDyPiwjqp_g6bZ0DzCMaoUM/edit?usp=sharing
.. image:: images/rllib-exploration-api-table.svg

An Exploration class implements the ``get_exploration_action`` method,
in which the exact exploratory behavior is defined.
It takes the model’s output, the action distribution class, the model itself,
a timestep (the global env-sampling steps already taken),
and an ``explore`` switch and outputs a tuple of a) action and
b) log-likelihood:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../rllib/utils/exploration/exploration.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __sphinx_doc_begin_get_exploration_action__
   :end-before: __sphinx_doc_end_get_exploration_action__

On the highest level, the ``Algorithm.compute_actions`` and ``Policy.compute_actions``
methods have a boolean ``explore`` switch, which is passed into
``Exploration.get_exploration_action``. If ``explore=None``, the value of
``Algorithm.config[“explore”]`` is used, which thus serves as a main switch for
exploratory behavior, allowing for example turning off any exploration easily for
evaluation purposes (see :ref:`CustomEvaluation`).

The following are example excerpts from different Algorithms' configs
(see ``rllib/algorithms/algorithm.py``) to setup different exploration behaviors:

.. TODO move to doc_code and make it use algo configs.
.. code-block:: python

    # All of the following configs go into Algorithm.config.

    # 1) Switching *off* exploration by default.
    # Behavior: Calling `compute_action(s)` without explicitly setting its `explore`
    # param will result in no exploration.
    # However, explicitly calling `compute_action(s)` with `explore=True` will
    # still(!) result in exploration (per-call overrides default).
    "explore": False,

    # 2) Switching *on* exploration by default.
    # Behavior: Calling `compute_action(s)` without explicitly setting its
    # explore param will result in exploration.
    # However, explicitly calling `compute_action(s)` with `explore=False`
    # will result in no(!) exploration (per-call overrides default).
    "explore": True,

    # 3) Example exploration_config usages:
    # a) DQN: see rllib/algorithms/dqn/dqn.py
    "explore": True,
    "exploration_config": {
       # Exploration sub-class by name or full path to module+class
       # (e.g. “ray.rllib.utils.exploration.epsilon_greedy.EpsilonGreedy”)
       "type": "EpsilonGreedy",
       # Parameters for the Exploration class' constructor:
       "initial_epsilon": 1.0,
       "final_epsilon": 0.02,
       "epsilon_timesteps": 10000,  # Timesteps over which to anneal epsilon.
    },

    # b) DQN Soft-Q: In order to switch to Soft-Q exploration, do instead:
    "explore": True,
    "exploration_config": {
       "type": "SoftQ",
       # Parameters for the Exploration class' constructor:
       "temperature": 1.0,
    },

    # c) All policy-gradient algos and SAC: see rllib/algorithms/algorithm.py
    # Behavior: The algo samples stochastically from the
    # model-parameterized distribution. This is the global Algorithm default
    # setting defined in algorithm.py and used by all PG-type algos (plus SAC).
    "explore": True,
    "exploration_config": {
       "type": "StochasticSampling",
       "random_timesteps": 0,  # timesteps at beginning, over which to act uniformly randomly
    },


.. _CustomEvaluation:

Customized Evaluation During Training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLlib reports online training rewards, however in some cases you may want to compute
rewards with different settings (for example, with exploration turned off, or on a specific set
of environment configurations). You can activate evaluating policies during training
(``Algorithm.train()``) by setting the ``evaluation_interval`` to an int value (> 0)
indicating every how many ``Algorithm.train()`` calls an "evaluation step" should be run:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_1_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_1_end__

An evaluation step runs - using its own ``EnvRunner``s - for ``evaluation_duration``
episodes or time-steps, depending on the ``evaluation_duration_unit`` setting, which can
take values of either ``"episodes"`` (default) or ``"timesteps"``.

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_2_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_2_end__

Note: When using ``evaluation_duration_unit=timesteps`` and your ``evaluation_duration``
setting isn't divisible by the number of evaluation workers (configurable with
``evaluation_num_env_runners``), RLlib rounds up the number of time-steps specified to
the nearest whole number of time-steps that is divisible by the number of evaluation
workers.
Also, when using ``evaluation_duration_unit=episodes`` and your
``evaluation_duration`` setting isn't divisible by the number of evaluation workers
(configurable with ``evaluation_num_env_runners``), RLlib runs the remainder of episodes
on the first n evaluation EnvRunners and leave the remaining workers idle for that time.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_3_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_3_end__

Before each evaluation step, weights from the main model are synchronized
to all evaluation workers.

By default, the evaluation step (if there is one in the current iteration) is run
right **after** the respective training step.
For example, for ``evaluation_interval=1``, the sequence of events is:
``train(0->1), eval(1), train(1->2), eval(2), train(2->3), ...``.
Here, the indices show the version of neural network weights used.
``train(0->1)`` is an update step that changes the weights from version 0 to
version 1 and ``eval(1)`` then uses weights version 1.
Weights index 0 represents the randomly initialized weights of the neural network.

Another example: For ``evaluation_interval=2``, the sequence is:
``train(0->1), train(1->2), eval(2), train(2->3), train(3->4), eval(4), ...``.

Instead of running ``train``- and ``eval``-steps in sequence, it is also possible to
run them in parallel with the ``evaluation_parallel_to_training=True`` config setting.
In this case, both training- and evaluation steps are run at the same time using multi-threading.
This can speed up the evaluation process significantly, but leads to a 1-iteration
delay between reported training- and evaluation results.
The evaluation results are behind in this case b/c they use slightly outdated
model weights (synchronized after the previous training step).

For example, for ``evaluation_parallel_to_training=True`` and ``evaluation_interval=1``,
the sequence is now:
``train(0->1) + eval(0), train(1->2) + eval(1), train(2->3) + eval(2)``,
where ``+`` connects phases happening at the same time.
Note that the change in the weights indices with respect to the non-parallel examples.
The evaluation weights indices are now "one behind"
the resulting train weights indices (``train(1->**2**) + eval(**1**)``).

When running with the ``evaluation_parallel_to_training=True`` setting, a special "auto" value
is supported for ``evaluation_duration``. This can be used to make the evaluation step take
roughly as long as the concurrently ongoing training step:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_4_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_4_end__

The ``evaluation_config`` key allows you to override any config settings for
the evaluation workers. For example, to switch off exploration in the evaluation steps,
do:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_5_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_5_end__


.. note::

    Policy gradient algorithms are able to find the optimal
    policy, even if this is a stochastic one. Setting "explore=False"
    results in the evaluation workers not using this stochastic policy.


The level of parallelism within the evaluation step is determined by the
``evaluation_num_env_runners`` setting. Set this to larger values if you want the desired
evaluation episodes or time-steps to run as much in parallel as possible.
For example, if your ``evaluation_duration=10``, ``evaluation_duration_unit=episodes``,
and ``evaluation_num_env_runners=10``, each evaluation ``EnvRunner``
only has to run one episode in each evaluation step.

In case you observe occasional failures in your (evaluation) EnvRunners during
evaluation (for example you have an environment that sometimes crashes or stalls),
you should use the following combination of settings, minimizing the negative effects
of such environment behavior:

Note that with or without parallel evaluation, all
:ref:`fault tolerance settings <rllib-scaling-guide>`, such as
``ignore_env_runner_failures`` or ``recreate_failed_env_runners`` are respected and applied
to the failed evaluation workers.

Here's an example:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_6_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_6_end__

This runs the parallel sampling of all evaluation EnvRunners, such that if one of
the workers takes too long to run through an episode and return data or fails entirely,
the other evaluation EnvRunners still complete the job.

In case you would like to entirely customize the evaluation step,
set ``custom_eval_function`` in your config to a callable, which takes the Algorithm
object and an :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner_group.EnvRunnerGroup` object (the Algorithm's ``self.evaluation_workers``
:py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner_group.EnvRunnerGroup` instance) and returns a metrics dictionary.
See `algorithm.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/algorithms/algorithm.py>`__
for further documentation.

There is also an end-to-end example of how to set up a custom online evaluation in
`custom_evaluation.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/evaluation/custom_evaluation.py>`__.
Note that if you only want to evaluate your policy at the end of training,
you can set ``evaluation_interval: [int]``, where ``[int]`` should be the number
of training iterations before stopping.

Below are some examples of how the custom evaluation metrics are reported nested under
the ``evaluation`` key of normal training results:

Rewriting Trajectories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that in the ``on_postprocess_traj`` callback you have full access to the
trajectory batch (``post_batch``) and other training state. This can be used to
rewrite the trajectory, which has a number of uses including:

 * Backdating rewards to previous time steps (for example, based on values in ``info``).
 * Adding model-based curiosity bonuses to rewards (you can train the model with a
   `custom model supervised loss <rllib-models.html#supervised-model-losses>`__).

To access the policy / model (``policy.model``) in the callbacks, note that
``info['pre_batch']`` returns a tuple where the first element is a policy and the
second one is the batch itself. You can also access all the rollout worker state
using the following call:

.. TODO move to doc_code and make it use algo configs.
.. code-block:: python

    from ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker import get_global_worker

    # You can use this from any callback to get a reference to the
    # RolloutWorker running in the process, which in turn has references to
    # all the policies, etc: see rollout_worker.py for more info.
    rollout_worker = get_global_worker()

Policy losses are defined over the ``post_batch`` data, so you can mutate that in
the callbacks to change what data the policy loss function sees.
