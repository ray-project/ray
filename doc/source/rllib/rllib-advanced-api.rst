Advanced Python APIs
--------------------

Custom training workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `basic training example <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/envs/custom_gym_env.py>`__,
Tune will call ``train()`` on your algorithm once per training iteration and report
the new training results.
Sometimes, it's desirable to have full control over training, but still run inside Tune.
Tune supports using :ref:`custom trainable functions <trainable-docs>` to
implement `custom training workflows (example) <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/ray_tune/custom_train_function.py>`__.

Curriculum learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In curriculum learning, you can set the environment to different difficulties
throughout the training process. This setting allows the algorithm to learn how to solve
the actual and final problem incrementally, by interacting with and exploring in more and
more difficult phases.
Normally, such a curriculum starts with setting the environment to an easy level and
then - as training progresses - transitions more toward a harder-to-solve difficulty.
See `Reverse Curriculum Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents <https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/12/20/reverse-curriculum/>`_ blog post
for another example of doing curriculum learning.

RLlib's Algorithm and custom callbacks APIs allow for implementing any arbitrary
curricula. This `example script <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/curriculum/curriculum_learning.py>`__ introduces
the basic concepts you need to understand.

First, define some env options. This example uses the `FrozenLake-v1` environment,
a grid world, whose map you can fully customize. RLlib represents three tasks of different env difficulties
with slightly different maps that the agent has to navigate.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../rllib/examples/curriculum/curriculum_learning.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __curriculum_learning_example_env_options__
   :end-before: __END_curriculum_learning_example_env_options__

Then, define the central piece controlling the curriculum, which is a custom callbacks class
overriding the :py:meth:`~ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks.RLlibCallback.on_train_result`.


.. TODO move to doc_code and make it use algo configs.
.. code-block:: python

    import ray
    from ray import tune
    from ray.rllib.callbacks.callbacks import RLlibCallback

    class MyCallbacks(RLlibCallback):
        def on_train_result(self, algorithm, result, **kwargs):
            if result["env_runners"]["episode_return_mean"] > 200:
                task = 2
            elif result["env_runners"]["episode_return_mean"] > 100:
                task = 1
            else:
                task = 0
            algorithm.env_runner_group.foreach_worker(
                lambda ev: ev.foreach_env(
                    lambda env: env.set_task(task)))

    ray.init()
    tune.Tuner(
        "PPO",
        param_space={
            "env": YourEnv,
            "callbacks": MyCallbacks,
        },
    ).fit()


Global coordination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes, you need to coordinate between pieces of code that live in different
processes managed by RLlib.
For example, it can be useful to maintain a global average of a certain variable,
or centrally control a hyperparameter that policies use.
Ray provides a general way to achieve this coordination through *named actors*. See
:ref:`Ray actors <actor-guide>` to learn more.
RLlib assigns these actors a global name. You can retrieve handles to them using
these names. As an example, consider maintaining a shared global counter that's
environments increment and read periodically from the driver program:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_counter_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_counter_end__

Ray actors provide high levels of performance. In more complex cases you can use them to
implement communication patterns such as parameter servers and all-reduce.


Visualizing custom metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _exploration-api:

Customizing exploration behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLlib offers a unified top-level API to configure and customize an agent’s
exploration behavior, including the decisions, like how and whether, to sample
actions from distributions, stochastically or deterministically.
Set up the behavior using built-in Exploration classes.
See `this package <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/utils/exploration/>`__),
which you specify and further configure inside
``AlgorithmConfig().env_runners(..)``.
Besides using one of the available classes, you can sub-class any of
these built-ins, add custom behavior to it, and use that new class in
the config instead.

Every policy has an Exploration object, which RLlib creates from the AlgorithmConfig’s
``.env_runners(exploration_config=...)`` method. The method specifies the class to use through the
special “type” key, as well as constructor arguments through all other keys. For example:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_explore_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_explore_end__

The following table lists all built-in Exploration sub-classes and the agents
that use them by default:

.. View table below at: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dEMhosbu7HVgHEwGBuMlEDyPiwjqp_g6bZ0DzCMaoUM/edit?usp=sharing
.. image:: images/rllib-exploration-api-table.svg

An Exploration class implements the ``get_exploration_action`` method,
in which you define the exact exploratory behavior.
It takes the model’s output, the action distribution class, the model itself,
a timestep, like the global env-sampling steps already taken,
and an ``explore`` switch. It outputs a tuple of a) action and
b) log-likelihood:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../rllib/utils/exploration/exploration.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __sphinx_doc_begin_get_exploration_action__
   :end-before: __sphinx_doc_end_get_exploration_action__

At the highest level, the ``Algorithm.compute_actions`` and ``Policy.compute_actions``
methods have a boolean ``explore`` switch, which RLlib passes into
``Exploration.get_exploration_action``. If ``explore=None``, RLlib uses the value of
``Algorithm.config[“explore”]``, which serves as a main switch for
exploratory behavior, allowing for example turning off of any exploration easily for
evaluation purposes. See :ref:`CustomEvaluation`.

The following are example excerpts from different Algorithms' configs
to setup different exploration behaviors from ``rllib/algorithms/algorithm.py``:

.. TODO move to doc_code and make it use algo configs.
.. code-block:: python

    # All of the following configs go into Algorithm.config.

    # 1) Switching *off* exploration by default.
    # Behavior: Calling `compute_action(s)` without explicitly setting its `explore`
    # param results in no exploration.
    # However, explicitly calling `compute_action(s)` with `explore=True`
    # still(!) results in exploration (per-call overrides default).
    "explore": False,

    # 2) Switching *on* exploration by default.
    # Behavior: Calling `compute_action(s)` without explicitly setting its
    # explore param results in exploration.
    # However, explicitly calling `compute_action(s)` with `explore=False`
    # results in no(!) exploration (per-call overrides default).
    "explore": True,

    # 3) Example exploration_config usages:
    # a) DQN: see rllib/algorithms/dqn/dqn.py
    "explore": True,
    "exploration_config": {
       # Exploration sub-class by name or full path to module+class
       # (e.g., “ray.rllib.utils.exploration.epsilon_greedy.EpsilonGreedy”)
       "type": "EpsilonGreedy",
       # Parameters for the Exploration class' constructor:
       "initial_epsilon": 1.0,
       "final_epsilon": 0.02,
       "epsilon_timesteps": 10000,  # Timesteps over which to anneal epsilon.
    },

    # b) DQN Soft-Q: In order to switch to Soft-Q exploration, do instead:
    "explore": True,
    "exploration_config": {
       "type": "SoftQ",
       # Parameters for the Exploration class' constructor:
       "temperature": 1.0,
    },

    # c) All policy-gradient algos and SAC: see rllib/algorithms/algorithm.py
    # Behavior: The algo samples stochastically from the
    # model-parameterized distribution. This is the global Algorithm default
    # setting defined in algorithm.py and used by all PG-type algos (plus SAC).
    "explore": True,
    "exploration_config": {
       "type": "StochasticSampling",
       "random_timesteps": 0,  # timesteps at beginning, over which to act uniformly randomly
    },


.. _CustomEvaluation:

Customized evaluation during training
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RLlib reports online training rewards, however in some cases you may want to compute
rewards with different settings. For example, with exploration turned off, or on a specific set
of environment configurations. You can activate evaluating policies during training
(``Algorithm.train()``) by setting the ``evaluation_interval`` to a positive integer.
This value specifies how many ``Algorithm.train()`` calls should occur each time
RLlib runs an "evaluation step":

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_1_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_1_end__

An evaluation step runs, using its own ``EnvRunner`` instances, for ``evaluation_duration``
episodes or time-steps, depending on the ``evaluation_duration_unit`` setting, which can take values
of either ``"episodes"``, which is the default, or ``"timesteps"``.

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_2_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_2_end__

Note that when using ``evaluation_duration_unit=timesteps`` and the ``evaluation_duration``
setting isn't divisible by the number of evaluation workers, RLlib rounds up the number of time-steps specified to
the nearest whole number of time-steps that's divisible by the number of evaluation
workers.
Also, when using ``evaluation_duration_unit=episodes`` and the
``evaluation_duration`` setting isn't divisible by the number of evaluation workers, RLlib runs the remainder of episodes
on the first n evaluation EnvRunners and leave the remaining workers idle for that time.
You can configure evaluation workers with ``evaluation_num_env_runners``.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_3_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_3_end__

Before each evaluation step, RLlib synchronizes weights from the main model
to all evaluation workers.

By default, RLlib runs the evaluation step, provided one exists in the current iteration,
immediately **after** the respective training step.
For example, for ``evaluation_interval=1``, the sequence of events is:
``train(0->1), eval(1), train(1->2), eval(2), train(2->3), ...``.
The indices show the version of neural network weights RLlib used.
``train(0->1)`` is an update step that changes the weights from version 0 to
version 1 and ``eval(1)`` then uses weights version 1.
Weights index 0 represents the randomly initialized weights of the neural network.

The following is another example. For ``evaluation_interval=2``, the sequence is:
``train(0->1), train(1->2), eval(2), train(2->3), train(3->4), eval(4), ...``.

Instead of running ``train`` and ``eval`` steps in sequence, you can also
run them in parallel with the ``evaluation_parallel_to_training=True`` config setting.
In this case, RLlib runs both training and evaluation steps at the same time using multi-threading.
This parallelization can speed up the evaluation process significantly, but leads to a 1-iteration
delay between reported training and evaluation results.
The evaluation results are behind in this case because they use slightly outdated
model weights, which RLlib synchronizes after the previous training step.

For example, for ``evaluation_parallel_to_training=True`` and ``evaluation_interval=1``,
the sequence is:
``train(0->1) + eval(0), train(1->2) + eval(1), train(2->3) + eval(2)``,
where ``+`` connects phases happening at the same time.
Note that the change in the weights indices are with respect to the non-parallel examples.
The evaluation weights indices are now "one behind"
the resulting train weights indices (``train(1->**2**) + eval(**1**)``).

When running with the ``evaluation_parallel_to_training=True`` setting, RLlib supports a special "auto" value
for ``evaluation_duration``. Use this auto setting to make the evaluation step take
roughly as long as the concurrently ongoing training step:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_4_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_4_end__

The ``evaluation_config`` key allows you to override any config settings for
the evaluation workers. For example, to switch off exploration in the evaluation steps,
do the following:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_5_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_5_end__


.. note::

    Policy gradient algorithms are able to find the optimal
    policy, even if this is a stochastic one. Setting "explore=False"
    results in the evaluation workers not using this stochastic policy.


RLlib determines the level of parallelism within the evaluation step by the
``evaluation_num_env_runners`` setting. Set this parameter to a larger value if you want the desired
evaluation episodes or time-steps to run as much in parallel as possible.
For example, if ``evaluation_duration=10``, ``evaluation_duration_unit=episodes``,
and ``evaluation_num_env_runners=10``, each evaluation ``EnvRunner``
only has to run one episode in each evaluation step.

In case you observe occasional failures in the evaluation EnvRunners during
evaluation, for example an environment that sometimes crashes or stalls,
use the following combination of settings, to minimize the negative effects
of that environment behavior:

.. todo (sven): Add link here to new fault-tolerance page, once done.
    :ref:`fault tolerance settings <rllib-fault-tolerance-docs>`, such as

Note that with or without parallel evaluation, RLlib respects all
fault tolerance settings, such as
``ignore_env_runner_failures`` or ``restart_failed_env_runners``, and applies them
to the failed evaluation workers.

The following is an example:

.. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/advanced_api.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_6_begin__
   :end-before: __rllib-adv_api_evaluation_6_end__

This example runs the parallel sampling of all evaluation EnvRunners, such that if one of
the workers takes too long to run through an episode and return data or fails entirely,
the other evaluation EnvRunners still complete the job.

If you want to entirely customize the evaluation step,
set ``custom_eval_function`` in the config to a callable, which takes the Algorithm
object and an :py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner_group.EnvRunnerGroup` object, the Algorithm's ``self.evaluation_workers``
:py:class:`~ray.rllib.env.env_runner_group.EnvRunnerGroup` instance, and returns a metrics dictionary.
See `algorithm.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/algorithms/algorithm.py>`__
for further documentation.

This end-to-end example shows how to set up a custom online evaluation in
`custom_evaluation.py <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/evaluation/custom_evaluation.py>`__.
Note that if you only want to evaluate your policy at the end of training,
set ``evaluation_interval: [int]``, where ``[int]`` should be the number
of training iterations before stopping.

Below are some examples of how RLlib reports the custom evaluation metrics nested under
the ``evaluation`` key of normal training results:

Rewriting trajectories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``on_postprocess_traj`` callback you have full access to the
trajectory batch (``post_batch``) and other training state. You can use this information to
rewrite the trajectory, which has a number of uses including:

 * Backdating rewards to previous time steps, for example, based on values in ``info``.
 * Adding model-based curiosity bonuses to rewards. You can train the model with a
   `custom model supervised loss <rllib-models.html#supervised-model-losses>`__.

To access the policy or model (``policy.model``) in the callbacks, note that
``info['pre_batch']`` returns a tuple where the first element is a policy and the
second one is the batch itself. You can also access all the rollout worker state
using the following call:

.. TODO move to doc_code and make it use algo configs.
.. code-block:: python

    from ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker import get_global_worker

    # You can use this call from any callback to get a reference to the
    # RolloutWorker running in the process. The RolloutWorker has references to
    # all the policies, etc. See rollout_worker.py for more info.
    rollout_worker = get_global_worker()

RLlib defines policy losses over the ``post_batch`` data, so you can mutate that in
the callbacks to change what data the policy loss function sees.
