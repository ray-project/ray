Using Ray with Pytorch Lightning
================================

.. note::
    `Ray Lightning Library <https://github.com/ray-project/ray_lightning>`_ will be deprecated in the future!

    In version 2.4, we introduced :class:`LightningTrainer <ray.train.lightning.LightningTrainer>`, which provides better integration with PyTorch Lightning.
    Please refer to :ref:`Train a PyTorch Lightning Image Classifier <lightning_mnist_example>` to learn how to use `LightningTrainer` for distributed model training.
