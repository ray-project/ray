====================================

Tune is a Python library for experiment execution and hyperparameter tuning at any scale. Core features:

  * Launch a multi-node `distributed hyperparameter sweep <tune-distributed.html>`_ in less than 10 lines of code.
  * Supports any machine learning framework, including PyTorch, XGBoost, MXNet, and Keras. See `examples here <tune-examples.html>`_.
  * Natively `integrates with optimization libraries <tune-searchalg.html>`_ such as `HyperOpt <https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt>`_, `Bayesian Optimization <https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization>`_, and `Facebook Ax <http://ax.dev>`_.
  * Choose among `scalable algorithms <tune-schedulers.html>`_ such as `Population Based Training (PBT)`_, `Vizier's Median Stopping Rule`_, `HyperBand/ASHA`_.
  * Visualize results with `TensorBoard <https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard>`__.

Quick Start
-----------

To run this example, you will need to install the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install 'ray[tune]' torch torchvision


This example runs a small grid search to train a CNN using PyTorch and Tune.

.. literalinclude:: ../../python/ray/tune/tests/example.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: __quick_start_begin__
   :end-before: __quick_start_end__

If TensorBoard is installed, automatically visualize all trial results:

.. code-block:: bash

    tensorboard --logdir ~/ray_results


.. image:: images/tune-start-tb.png
    :scale: 30%
    :align: center

If using TF2 and TensorBoard, Tune will also automatically generate TensorBoard HParams output:

.. image:: images/tune-hparams-coord.png
    :scale: 20%
    :align: center

Take a look at the `Distributed Experiments <tune-distributed.html>`_ documentation for:

 1. Setting up distributed experiments on your local cluster
 2. Using AWS and GCP
 3. Spot instance usage/pre-emptible instances, and more.
