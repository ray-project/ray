    "We strongly recommend using [Ray AIR Tuner](air-tuner) for hyperparameter tuning/AutoML, which will enable you to build it faster and more easily, and get the built-in benefits like logging, fault tolerance and many more. If you think your use case cannot be supported by Ray AIR, we'd love to get your feedback e.g. through a [Ray GitHub issue](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues).\n",

    "AutoML (Automatic Machine Learning) is a broad topic, but in essence, it boils down to choosing the best model (and possibly preprocessing) for the task and dataset at hand. While there exist multiple advanced AutoML frameworks, we can quickly build a simple solution using just Ray Core and stateless tasks.\n",

    "Simple AutoML consists of running different functions (hyperparameter configurations) on the same data independently of each other.

    "To make this example more practical, we will be using [time series cross-validation (CV)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html) as our evaluation strategy. Cross-validation works by evaluating a model k-times, each time choosing a different subset (fold) of the data for training and evaluation. This allows for more robust estimation of performance and helps prevent overfitting, especially with small data. In other words, we will be running n * k separate evaluations, where n is the number of configurations and k is the number of folds."
