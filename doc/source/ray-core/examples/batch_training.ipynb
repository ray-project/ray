    "We want to analyze the relationship between the dropoff location and the trip duration. The relationship will be very different for each pickup location, therefore we need to have a separate model for each of those. Furthermore, the relationship can change with time. Therefore, our task is to create separate models for each pickup location-month combination. The dataset we are using is already partitioned into months (each file being equal to one), and we can use the `pickup_location_id` column in the dataset to group it into data batches. We will then fit models for each batch and choose the best one.\n",

If we have sufficient memory in our Ray cluster, we can instead load each partition once, extract the batches, and save them in the [Ray object store](objects-in-ray), reducing time required dramatically at a cost of higher memory usage. In other words, we perform centralized data loading using Ray object store as opposed to distributed data loading.\n",

Instead, we pass the reference itself as the argument to the `train_and_evaluate.remote` dispatch, [allowing for the data to stay in the object store until it is actually needed](unnecessary-ray-get). This avoids a situation where all the data would be loaded into the memory of the process calling `ray.get()`.\n",

Therefore, this pattern is only recommended if the data you are working with is small. Otherwise, it is recommended to load the data inside the tasks right before its used. As always, your mileage may vary - we recommend you try both approaches for your workload and see what works best for you!"
