    "We strongly recommend using [Ray Datasets](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/examples/nyc_taxi_basic_processing.html#parallel-batch-inference) or [AIR](_air-predictors) to develop batch prediction, which will enable you to build it faster and more easily, and get the built-in benefits like auto-scaling actor pool. If you think your use case cannot be supported by Ray Datasets or AIR, please file an issue in [Ray GitHub](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues) to get advice before you proceed. \n",

    "The batch prediction is the process of using a trained model to generate predictions for a collection of observations. It has the following elements:\n",
    "* Input dataset: this is a collection of observations to generate predictions for. The data is usually stored in an external storage system like S3, HDFS or database, and can be large.\n",
    "* ML model: this is a trained ML model which is usually also stored in an external storage system.\n",
    "* Predictions: these are the outputs when applying the ML model on observations. The predictions are usually written back to the storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ray, you can build scalable batch prediction for large datasets at high prediction throughput. This is achieved by splitting the dataset into disjoint shards and executing them in parallel, with either Ray tasks or Ray actors across a Ray cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "In general, actor-based batch prediction is preferred for higher efficiency. This is because the actor is stateful and it can reuse the expensive initialization across tasks.\n",

    "3. Each worker executes predictions on the assigned shard, and writes out results\n",
