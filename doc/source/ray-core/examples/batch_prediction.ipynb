    "The batch prediction is the process of using a trained model to generate predictions for a collection of observations. It has the following elements:\n",
    "* Input dataset: this is a collection of observations to generate predictions for. The data is usually stored in an external storage system like S3, HDFS or database, and can be large.\n",
    "* ML model: this is a trained ML model which is usually also stored in an external storage system.\n",
    "* Predictions: these are the outputs when applying the ML model on observations. The predictions are usually written back to the storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ray, you can build scalable batch prediction for large datasets at high prediction throughput. This is achieved by splitting the dataset into disjoint shards and executing them in parallel, with either Ray tasks or Ray actors across a Ray cluster.\n",

    "2. Launches Ray tasks, with each taking in the model and a shard of input dataset\n",
    "3. Each worker executes predictions on the assigned shard, and writes out results\n",
