    "1. Map phase\n",
    "   The map phase applies a specified function to transform or _map_ elements within a set of data. It produces key-value pairs: the key represents an element and the value is a metric calculated for that element.\n",
    "   To count the number of times each word appears in a document,\n",
    "   the map function outputs the pair `(word, 1)` every time a word appears, to indicate that it has been found once.\n",
    "2. Shuffle phase\n",
    "   The shuffle phase collects all the outputs from the map phase and organizes them by key. When the same key is found on multiple compute nodes, this phase includes transferring or _shuffling_ data between different nodes.\n",
    "   If the map phase produces four occurrences of the pair `(word, 1)`, the shuffle phase puts all occurrences of the word on the same node.\n",
    "3. Reduce phase\n",
    "   The reduce phase aggregates the elements from the shuffle phase.\n",
    "   The total count of each word's occurrences is the sum of occurrences on each node.\n",
    "   For example, four instances of `(word, 1)` combine for a final count of `word: 4`."
