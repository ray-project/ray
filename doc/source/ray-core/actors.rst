Actors
======

Actors extend the Ray API from functions (tasks) to classes.
An actor is essentially a stateful worker (or a service). When a new actor is
instantiated, a new worker is created, and methods of the actor are scheduled on
that specific worker and can access and mutate the state of that worker.

.. tabbed:: Python

    The ``ray.remote`` decorator indicates that instances of the ``Counter`` class will be actors. Each actor runs in its own Python process.

    .. code-block:: python

      @ray.remote
      class Counter(object):
          def __init__(self):
              self.value = 0

          def increment(self):
              self.value += 1
              return self.value

          def get_counter(self):
              return self.value

      # Create an actor from this class.
      counter = Counter.remote()

.. tabbed:: Java

    ``Ray.actor`` is used to create actors from regular Java classes.

    .. code-block:: java

      // A regular Java class.
      public class Counter {

        private int value = 0;

        public int increment() {
          this.value += 1;
          return this.value;
        }
      }

      // Create an actor from this class.
      // `Ray.actor` takes a factory method that can produce
      // a `Counter` object. Here, we pass `Counter`'s constructor
      // as the argument.
      ActorHandle<Counter> counter = Ray.actor(Counter::new).remote();

.. tabbed:: C++

    ``ray::Actor`` is used to create actors from regular C++ classes.

    .. code-block:: c++

      // A regular C++ class.
      class Counter {

      private:
          int value = 0;

      public:
        int Increment() {
          value += 1;
          return value;
        }
      };

      // Factory function of Counter class.
      static Counter *CreateCounter() {
          return new Counter();
      };

      RAY_REMOTE(&Counter::Increment, CreateCounter);

      // Create an actor from this class.
      // `ray::Actor` takes a factory method that can produce
      // a `Counter` object. Here, we pass `Counter`'s factory function
      // as the argument.
      auto counter = ray::Actor(CreateCounter).Remote();

Specifying required resources
-----------------------------

.. _actor-resource-guide:

You can specify resource requirements in actors too (see :ref:`resource-requirements` for more details.)

.. tabbed:: Python

    .. code-block:: python

        # Specify required resources for an actor.
        @ray.remote(num_cpus=2, num_gpus=0.5)
        class Actor(object):
            pass

.. tabbed:: Java

    .. code-block:: java

        // Specify required resources for an actor.
        Ray.actor(Counter::new).setResource("CPU", 2.0).setResource("GPU", 0.5).remote();

.. tabbed:: C++

    .. code-block:: c++

        // Specify required resources for an actor.
        ray::Actor(CreateCounter).SetResource("CPU", 2.0).SetResource("GPU", 0.5).Remote();


Calling the actor
-----------------

We can interact with the actor by calling its methods with the ``remote``
operator. We can then call ``get`` on the object ref to retrieve the actual
value.

.. tabbed:: Python

    .. code-block:: python

        # Call the actor.
        obj_ref = counter.increment.remote()
        assert ray.get(obj_ref) == 1

.. tabbed:: Java

    .. code-block:: java

        // Call the actor.
        ObjectRef<Integer> objectRef = counter.task(&Counter::increment).remote();
        Assert.assertTrue(objectRef.get() == 1);

.. tabbed:: C++

    .. code-block:: c++

        // Call the actor.
        auto object_ref = counter.Task(&Counter::increment).Remote();
        assert(*object_ref.Get() == 1);

Methods called on different actors can execute in parallel, and methods called on the same actor are executed serially in the order that they are called. Methods on the same actor will share state with one another, as shown below.

.. tabbed:: Python

    .. code-block:: python

        # Create ten Counter actors.
        counters = [Counter.remote() for _ in range(10)]

        # Increment each Counter once and get the results. These tasks all happen in
        # parallel.
        results = ray.get([c.increment.remote() for c in counters])
        print(results)  # prints [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

        # Increment the first Counter five times. These tasks are executed serially
        # and share state.
        results = ray.get([counters[0].increment.remote() for _ in range(5)])
        print(results)  # prints [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

.. tabbed:: Java

    .. code-block:: java

        // Create ten Counter actors.
        List<ActorHandle<Counter>> counters = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            counters.add(Ray.actor(Counter::new).remote());
        }

        // Increment each Counter once and get the results. These tasks all happen in
        // parallel.
        List<ObjectRef<Integer>> objectRefs = new ArrayList<>();
        for (ActorHandle<Counter> counterActor : counters) {
            objectRefs.add(counterActor.task(Counter::increment).remote());
        }
        // prints [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
        System.out.println(Ray.get(objectRefs));

        // Increment the first Counter five times. These tasks are executed serially
        // and share state.
        objectRefs = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            objectRefs.add(counters.get(0).task(Counter::increment).remote());
        }
        // prints [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        System.out.println(Ray.get(objectRefs));

.. tabbed:: C++

    .. code-block:: c++

        // Create ten Counter actors.
        std::vector<ray::ActorHandle<Counter>> counters;
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            counters.emplace_back(ray::Actor(CreateCounter).Remote());
        }

        // Increment each Counter once and get the results. These tasks all happen in
        // parallel.
        std::vector<ray::ObjectRef<int>> object_refs;
        for (ray::ActorHandle<Counter> counter_actor : counters) {
            object_refs.emplace_back(counter_actor.Task(&Counter::Increment).Remote());
        }
        // prints 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
        auto results = ray::Get(object_refs);
        for (const auto &result : results) {
            std::cout << *result;
        }

        // Increment the first Counter five times. These tasks are executed serially
        // and share state.
        object_refs.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            object_refs.emplace_back(counters[0].Task(&Counter::Increment).Remote());
        }
        // prints 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
        results = ray::Get(object_refs);
        for (const auto &result : results) {
            std::cout << *result;
        }

Passing Around Actor Handles
----------------------------

Actor handles can be passed into other tasks. We can define remote functions (or actor methods) that use actor handles.

.. tabbed:: Python

    .. code-block:: python

        import time

        @ray.remote
        def f(counter):
            for _ in range(1000):
                time.sleep(0.1)
                counter.increment.remote()

.. tabbed:: Java

    .. code-block:: java

        public static class MyRayApp {

          public static void foo(ActorHandle<Counter> counter) throws InterruptedException {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
              TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(100);
              counter.task(Counter::increment).remote();
            }
          }
        }

.. tabbed:: C++

    .. code-block:: c++

        void Foo(ray::ActorHandle<Counter> counter) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
                counter.Task(&Counter::Increment).Remote();
            }
        }

If we instantiate an actor, we can pass the handle around to various tasks.

.. tabbed:: Python

    .. code-block:: python

        counter = Counter.remote()

        # Start some tasks that use the actor.
        [f.remote(counter) for _ in range(3)]

        # Print the counter value.
        for _ in range(10):
            time.sleep(1)
            print(ray.get(counter.get_counter.remote()))

.. tabbed:: Java

    .. code-block:: java

        ActorHandle<Counter> counter = Ray.actor(Counter::new).remote();

        // Start some tasks that use the actor.
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          Ray.task(MyRayApp::foo, counter).remote();
        }

        // Print the counter value.
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
          System.out.println(counter.task(Counter::getCounter).remote().get());
        }

.. tabbed:: C++

    .. code-block:: c++

        auto counter = ray::Actor(CreateCounter).Remote();

        // Start some tasks that use the actor.
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          ray::Task(Foo).Remote(counter);
        }

        // Print the counter value.
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
          std::cout << *counter.Task(&Counter::GetCounter).Remote().Get() << std::endl;
        }

FAQ: Actors, Workers and Resources
----------------------------------

What's the difference between a worker and an actor?

Each "Ray worker" is a python process.

Workers are treated differently for tasks and actors. Any "Ray worker" is either 1. used to execute multiple Ray tasks or 2. is started as a dedicated Ray actor.

* **Tasks**: When Ray starts on a machine, a number of Ray workers will be started automatically (1 per CPU by default). They will be used to execute tasks (like a process pool). If you execute 8 tasks with `num_cpus=2`, and total number of CPUs is 16 (`ray.cluster_resources()["CPU"] == 16`), you will end up with 8 of your 16 workers idling.

* **Actor**: A Ray Actor is also a "Ray worker" but is instantiated at runtime (upon `actor_cls.remote()`). All of its methods will run on the same process, using the same resources (designated when defining the Actor). Note that unlike tasks, the python processes that runs Ray Actors are not reused and will be terminated when the Actor is deleted.

To maximally utilize your resources, you want to maximize the time that
your workers are working. You also want to allocate enough cluster resources
so that both all of your needed actors can run and any other tasks you
define can run. This also implies that tasks are scheduled more flexibly,
and that if you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly
better off using tasks.
