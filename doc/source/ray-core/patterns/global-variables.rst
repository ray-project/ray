Anti-pattern: Accessing or modifying global variables in tasks and actors
=========================================================================

**TLDR:** Don't access or modify global variables in remote functions and classes. Instead, encapsulate the global variables into an actor's instance variables.

Ray drivers, tasks and actors are running in
different processes, so they donâ€™t share the same address space.
This means that if you modify global variables
in one process, changes are not reflected in other processes.

The solution is to use an actor's instance variables to hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed.
Note that using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported.
Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the class variables.

**Anti-pattern:**

.. literalinclude:: ../doc_code/anti_pattern_global_variables.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __anti_pattern_start__
    :end-before: __anti_pattern_end__

**Better approach:**

.. literalinclude:: ../doc_code/anti_pattern_global_variables.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: __better_approach_start__
    :end-before: __better_approach_end__
