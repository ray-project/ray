Profiling
=========

Ray Compiled Graph provides profiling functionalities to better understand the performance
of individual tasks, systems overhead, and performance bottlenecks.

Nsight system profiler
----------------------

Compiled Graph build on top of Ray's profiling capabilities, and leverage Nsight
system profiling. 

To run Nsight Profiling on Compiled Graph, specify the runtime_env for the involved actors
as described in :ref:`Run Nsight on Ray <run-nsight-on-ray>`.

After execution, Compiled Graph generates the profiling results under the `/tmp/ray/session_*/logs/{profiler_name}`
directory.

For fine-grained performance analysis of method calls and system overhead, set the environment variable
``RAY_CGRAPH_ENABLE_NVTX_PROFILING=1`` when running the script. For example, for a Compiled Graph script
in ``example.py``, run the following command:

.. testcode::

    RAY_CGRAPH_ENABLE_NVTX_PROFILING=1 python3 example.py


This command leverages the `NVTX library <https://nvtx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#>`_ to automatically
annotate all methods called in the execution loops of compiled graph.

To visualize the profiling results, follow the same instructions as described in 
:ref:`Nsight Profiling Result <profiling-result>`.

Visualization
-------------
To visualize the graph structure, call the ``visualize`` method after calling ``experimental_compile``
on the graph.

.. testcode::

    import ray
    from ray.dag import InputNode, MultiOutputNode

    @ray.remote
    class Worker:
        def inc(self, x):
            return x + 1

        def double(self, x):
            return x * 2

        def echo(self, x):
            return x

    sender1 = Worker.remote()
    sender2 = Worker.remote()
    receiver = Worker.remote()

    with InputNode() as inp:
        w1 = sender1.inc.bind(inp)
        w1 = receiver.echo.bind(w1)
        w2 = sender2.double.bind(inp)
        w2 = receiver.echo.bind(w2)
        dag = MultiOutputNode([w1, w2])

    compiled_dag = dag.experimental_compile()
    compiled_dag.visualize()

By default, Ray generates a PNG image named ``compiled_graph.png`` and saves it in the current working directory.
Note that this requires ``graphviz``.

The visualization for the preceding code is shown below.
Tasks of the same actor are shown in the same color.
