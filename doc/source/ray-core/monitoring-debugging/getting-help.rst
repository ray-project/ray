Discourse Forum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Discourse Forum` is the primary place to ask questions, where the Ray committers, contributors, and other Ray users answer questions.
Someone from the community may have already answered your question, so before you ask a new question, please make sure to search them.
The Ray contributors monitor the forum daily and expect to respond within a day.

Bugs or Feature Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes, the question or problem you have turns out to be a real bug or requires an enhancement request. In this case,
file a new issue to the `GitHub Issues`_ page. Ray contributors will triage and
address them accordingly.

StackOverflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can also ask questions to `StackOverflow`_ with a Ray tag. On StackOverflow, we strive to respond to questions within 3~5 days.

Slack
~~~~~
Many Ray users hang out on Ray `Slack`_ (the invitation is open to everyone). You can join the slack and directly communicate to other Ray users or contributors.
For asking questions, we recommend using the discourse forum or StackOverflow for future searchability.
