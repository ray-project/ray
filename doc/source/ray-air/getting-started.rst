Ray for ML Infrastructure
=========================

.. tip::

    We'd love to hear from you if you are using Ray to build a ML platform! Fill out `this short form <https://forms.gle/wCCdbaQDtgErYycT6>`__ to get involved.

Ray and its AI libraries provide unified compute runtime for teams looking to simplify their ML platform.
Ray's libraries such as Ray Train, Ray Data, and Ray Serve can be used to compose end-to-end ML workflows, providing features and APIs for
data preprocessing as part of training, and transitioning from training to serving.

Why Ray for ML Infrastructure?
------------------------------

Ray's AI libraries simplify the ecosystem of machine learning frameworks, platforms, and tools, by providing a seamless, unified, and open experience for scalable ML:

**1. Seamless Dev to Prod**: Ray's AI libraries reduces friction going from development to production. With Ray and its libraries, the same Python code scales seamlessly from a laptop to a large cluster.

**2. Unified ML API and Runtime**: Ray's APIs enables swapping between popular frameworks, such as XGBoost, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, with minimal code changes. Everything from training to serving runs on a single runtime (Ray + KubeRay).

**3. Open and Extensible**: Ray is fully open-source and can run on any cluster, cloud, or Kubernetes. Build custom components and integrations on top of scalable developer APIs.

Example ML Platforms built on Ray
---------------------------------

`Merlin <https://shopify.engineering/merlin-shopify-machine-learning-platform>`_ is Shopify's ML platform built on Ray. It enables fast-iteration and `scaling of distributed applications <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbvzvdKH7bc>`_ such as product categorization and recommendations.
