Ray Train creates workers in a Ray cluster and configures the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable for you. This way, you can use simply use a strategy from `tf.distribute` to run your training loop across multiple workers in a distributed data-parallel fashion! Currently, the only multi-worker strategy that Train supports is [`tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training#multiworkermirroredstrategy), which shards the dataset evenly across workers and synchronizes parameter updates so that workers share the same weights at all times."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how a few lines of code with Ray AIR API's can allow you to scale up your Tensorflow model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned how to:\n",
    "- enable distributed training using Ray Train abstractions\n",
    "- save and retrieve model checkpoints via Ray AIR\n",
    "- load a model for batch prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In our [other examples](air-examples-ref) you can learn how to do more things with the Ray AIR API, such as **serving your model with Ray Serve** or **tune your hyperparameters with Ray Tune**. You can also learn how to **construct Ray Datasets** to leverage Ray AIR’s **preprocessing** API.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this table](train-framework-catalog) for a full catalog of frameworks that AIR supports out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope this tutorial gave you a good starting point to leverage Ray AIR. If you have any questions, suggestions, or run into any problems pelase reach out on [Discuss](https://discuss.ray.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) or the [Ray Slack](https://forms.gle/9TSdDYUgxYs8SA9e8)!"
