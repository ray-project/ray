This particular model has 6 billion parameters. For more information on GPT-J, click [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gptj).\n",

    "Setting up basic serving with Ray Serve is very similar to {doc}`batch inference with Ray Data </ray-air/examples/gptj_batch_prediction>`. First, we define a callable class that will serve as the [Serve deployment](serve-key-concepts-deployment). At runtime, a deployment consists of a number of *replicas*, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down (or even autoscaled) to match the incoming request load.\n",
