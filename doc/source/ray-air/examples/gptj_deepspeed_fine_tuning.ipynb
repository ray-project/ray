    "\n",
    "In this example, we will showcase how to use the Ray AIR for **GPT-J fine-tuning**. GPT-J is a GPT-2-like causal language model trained on the Pile dataset. This particular model has 6 billion parameters. For more information on GPT-J, click [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gptj).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Ray AIR (with the 🤗 Transformers integration) and a pretrained model from Hugging Face hub. Note that you can easily adapt this example to use other similar models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example focuses more on the performance and distributed computing aspects of Ray AIR. If you are looking for a more beginner-friendly introduction to Ray AIR 🤗 Transformers integration, see {doc}`this example </ray-air/examples/huggingface_text_classification>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended to read [Ray Train Key Concepts](train-key-concepts) and [Ray Data Key Concepts](data_key_concepts) before starting this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "To run this example, make sure your Ray cluster has access to at least one GPU with 16 or more GBs of memory. The required amount of memory depends on the model. This notebook is tested with 16 g4dn.4xlarge instances (including the head node). If you wish to use a CPU head node, turn on [cloud checkpointing](tune-cloud-checkpointing) to avoid OOM errors that may happen due to the default behavior of syncing the checkpoint files to the head node.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can now configure Ray AIR's {class}`~ray.train.huggingface.TransformersTrainer` to perform distributed fine-tuning of the model. In order to do that, we specify a `trainer_init_per_worker` function, which creates a 🤗 Transformers `Trainer` that will be distributed by Ray using Distributed Data Parallelism (using PyTorch Distributed backend internally). This means that each worker will have its own copy of the model, but operate on different data, At the end of each step, all the workers will sync gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT-J is a relatively large model, it may not be possible to fit it on smaller GPU types (<=16 GB GRAM). To deal with that issue, we can use [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), a library to optimize the training process and allow us to (among other things) offload and partition optimizer and parameter states, reducing GRAM usage. Furthermore, DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 allows us to load large models without running out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "🤗 Transformers and Ray AIR's integration ({class}`~ray.train.huggingface.TransformersTrainer`) allow you to easily configure and use DDP and DeepSpeed. All you need to do is specify the DeepSpeed configuration in the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) object.\n",

    "There are many DeepSpeed settings that allow you to trade-off speed for memory usage. The settings used below are tailored to the cluster setup used (16 g4dn.4xlarge nodes) and per device batch size of 16. Some things to keep in mind:\n",
    "- If your GPUs support bfloat16, use that instead of float16 mixed precision to get better performance and prevent overflows. Replace `fp16=True` with `bf16=True` in `TrainingArguments`.\n",
    "- If you are running out of GRAM: try reducing batch size (defined in the cell below the next one), set `\"overlap_comm\": False` in DeepSpeed config.\n",
    "- If you are running out of RAM, add more nodes to your cluster, use nodes with more RAM, set `\"pin_memory\": False` in the DeepSpeed config, reduce the batch size, and remove `\"offload_param\"` from the DeepSpeed config.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on DeepSpeed configuration, refer to [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/deepspeed) and [DeepSpeed documentation](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/).\n",

By changing the number of workers, we can change the **effective batch size** and thus the time needed for training to complete. The effective batch size is then calculated as `per device batch size * number of workers * number of gradient accumulation steps`. As we add more workers, the effective batch size rises and thus we need less time to complete a full epoch. While the speedup is not exactly linear due to extra communication overheads, in many cases it can be close to linear.\n",
