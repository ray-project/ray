Vale catches typos and grammatical errors. It also enforces stylistic rules like 
“use contractions” and “use second person.” For the full list of rules, see the 
[configuration in the Ray repository](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/.vale/styles/Google).

## Vale doesn’t recognize a word. What do you do?

To add custom terminology, complete the following steps:

1. If it doesn’t already exist, create a directory for your team in 
`.vale/styles/Vocab`. For example, `.vale/styles/Vocab/Data`.
2. If it doesn’t already exist, create a text file named `accept.txt`. For example, 
`.vale/styles/Vocab/Data/accept.txt`.
3. Add your term to `accept.txt`. Vale accepts Regex.

documentation.
