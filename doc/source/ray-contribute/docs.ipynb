    "# Contributing to the Ray Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to contribute to the Ray documentation, and we're always looking for new contributors.\n",
    "Even if you just want to fix a typo or expand on a section, please feel free to do so!\n",
    "\n",
    "This document walks you through everything you need to do to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Ray documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to contribute to the Ray documentation, you'll need a way to build it.\n",
    "You don't have to build Ray itself, which is a bit more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just have to [clone the Ray repository](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-contribute/development.html#clone-the-repository), then [prepare the Python environment](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-contribute/development.html#prepare-the-python-environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, change into the `ray/doc` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd ray/doc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you are on an Apple Silicon (M1) read the instructions below for installing the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you activate the Python environment you are using (e.g. venv, conda, etc.) and then to install the documentation dependencies, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-doc.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's best if you install the dependencies for our linters with\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r ../python/requirements_linters.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so that you can make sure your changes comply with our style guide.\n",
    "Building the documentation is done by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "make develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which will build the documentation into the `_build` directory.\n",
    "After the build finishes, you can simply open the `_build/html/index.html` file in your browser.\n",
    "It's considered good practice to check the output of your build to make sure everything is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before committing any changes, make sure you run the \n",
    "[linter](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-contribute/getting-involved.html#lint-and-formatting)\n",
    "with `../scripts/format.sh` from the `doc` folder,\n",
    "to make sure your changes are formatted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducing CI build failures locally, you might want to use `make html`, which\n",
    "is the same as `make develop` but treats warnings as errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Docs for Apple Silicon (M1)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using an Apple Silicon (M1) some of the dependencies required for building the docs don't have binary packages available by default (not available in PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to install those dependencies is with `conda` (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) first, that way `pip` won't try to install them by building them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, make sure you create and/or activate the conda environment, and then install the dependencies with:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge xgboost lightgbm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you can install the other dependencies as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics of our build system\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray documentation is built using the [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) build system.\n",
    "We're using the [Sphinx Book Theme](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme) from the\n",
    "[executable books project](https://github.com/executablebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that you can write Ray documentation in either Sphinx's native \n",
    "[reStructuredText (rST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) or in\n",
    "[Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "The two formats can be converted to each other, so the choice is up to you.\n",
    "Having said that, it's important to know that MyST is\n",
    "[common markdown compliant](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/reference.html#commonmark-block-tokens).\n",
    "If you intend to add a new document, we recommend starting from an `.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray documentation also fully supports executable formats like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "Many of our examples are notebooks with [MyST markdown cells](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "In fact, this very document you're reading _is_ a notebook.\n",
    "You can check this for yourself by either downloading the `.ipynb` file,\n",
    "or directly launching this notebook into either Binder or Google Colab in the top navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to contribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take Ray Tune as an example, you can see that our documentation is made up of several types of documentation,\n",
    "all of which you can contribute to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [a project landing page](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html),\n",
    "- [a getting started guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/getting-started.html),\n",
    "- [a key concepts page](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/key-concepts.html),\n",
    "- [user guides for key features](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/tutorials/overview.html),\n",
    "- [practical examples](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/index.html),\n",
    "- [a detailed FAQ](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/faq.html),\n",
    "- [and API references](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure is reflected in the\n",
    "[Ray documentation source code](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/doc/source/tune) as well, so you\n",
    "should have no problem finding what you're looking for.\n",
    "All other Ray projects share a similar structure, but depending on the project there might be minor differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of documentation listed above has its own purpose, but at the end our documentation\n",
    "comes down to _two types_ of documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markup documents, written in MyST or rST. If you don't have a lot of (executable) code to contribute or\n",
    "  use more complex features such as\n",
    "  [tabbed content blocks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html#starting-ray), this is the right\n",
    "  choice. Most of the documents in Ray Tune are written in this way, for instance the\n",
    "  [key concepts](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/key-concepts.rst) or\n",
    "  [API documentation](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/api_docs/overview.rst).\n",
    "- Notebooks, written in `.ipynb` format. All Tune examples are written as notebooks. These notebooks render in\n",
    "  the browser like `.md` or `.rst` files, but have the added benefit of adding launch buttons to the top of the\n",
    "  document, so that users can run the code themselves in either Binder or Google Colab. A good first example to look\n",
    "  at is [this Tune example](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/examples/tune-serve-integration-mnist.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing typos and improving explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you spot a typo in any document, or think that an explanation is not clear enough, please consider\n",
    "opening a pull request.\n",
    "In this scenario, just run the linter as described above and submit your pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding API references\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Sphinx's autodoc extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to generate\n",
    "our API documentation from our source code.\n",
    "In case we're missing a reference to a function or class, please consider adding it to the respective document in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's how you can add a function or class reference using `autofunction` and `autoclass`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ".. autofunction:: ray.tune.integration.docker.DockerSyncer\n",
    "\n",
    ".. autoclass:: ray.tune.integration.keras.TuneReportCallback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above snippet was taken from the\n",
    "[Tune API documentation](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/api_docs/integration.rst),\n",
    "which you can look at for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change the content of the API documentation, you will have to edit the respective function or class\n",
    "signatures directly in the source code.\n",
    "For example, in the above `autofunction` call, to change the API reference for `ray.tune.integration.docker.DockerSyncer`,\n",
    "you would have to [change the following source file](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/7f1bacc7dc9caf6d0ec042e39499bbf1d9a7d065/python/ray/tune/integration/docker.py#L15-L38).\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the usage of APIs, it is important to have small usage examples embedded in the API documentation. These should be self-contained and run out of the box, so a user can copy and paste them into a Python interpreter and play around with them (e.g., if applicable, they should point to example data). Users often rely on these examples to build their applications. To learn more about writing examples, read [How to write code snippets](writing-code-snippets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding code to an `.rST` or `.md` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying text in an existing documentation file is easy, but you need to be careful when it comes to adding code.\n",
    "The reason is that we want to ensure every code snippet on our documentation is tested.\n",
    "This requires us to have a process for including and testing code snippets in documents. To learn how to write testable code \n",
    "snippets, read [How to write code snippets](writing-code-snippets).\n"
