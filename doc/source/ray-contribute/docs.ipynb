    "# Contributing to the Ray Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to contribute to the Ray documentation, and we're always looking for new contributors.\n",
    "Even if you just want to fix a typo or expand on a section, please feel free to do so!\n",
    "\n",
    "This document walks you through everything you need to do to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Editorial style\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).\n",
    "Here are some highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Use present tense](https://developers.google.com/style/tense)\n",
    "* [Use second person](https://developers.google.com/style/person)\n",
    "* [Use contractions](https://developers.google.com/style/contractions)\n",
    "* [Use active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice)\n",
    "* [Use sentence case](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization)\n",

    "## Building the Ray documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to contribute to the Ray documentation, you need a way to build it.\n",
    "Don't install Ray in the environment you plan to use to build documentation. The requirements for the docs build system are generally not compatible with those you need to run Ray itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the these instructions to build the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fork Ray\n",
    "1. [Fork the Ray repository](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-contribute/development.html#fork-the-ray-repository)\n",
    "2. [Clone the forked repository](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-contribute/development.html#fork-the-ray-repository) to your local machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, change into the `ray/doc` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd ray/doc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't done so already, create a Python environment, preferably using the latest version of Python. For example, if you're using `conda`:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda create -n docs python=3.12\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, activate the Python environment you are using (e.g., venv, conda, etc.). With `conda` this would be:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda activate docs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Install the documentation dependencies with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r requirements-doc.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use `-U` in this step. You don't want to upgrade dependencies because `requirements-doc.txt` pins exact versions you need to build the docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build documentation\n",
    "Build the documentation by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "make develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the documentation build in the `_build` directory.\n",
    "After the build finishes, you can simply open the `_build/html/index.html` file in your browser.\n",
    "It's considered good practice to check the output of your build to make sure everything is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before committing any changes, make sure you run the \n",
    "[linter](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-contribute/getting-involved.html#lint-and-formatting)\n",
    "with `../scripts/format.sh` from the `doc` folder,\n",
    "to make sure your changes are formatted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics of our build system\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray documentation is built using the [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) build system.\n",
    "We're using the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [`myst-parser`](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to allow you to write Ray documentation in either Sphinx's native \n",
    "[reStructuredText (rST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) or in\n",
    "[Markedly Structured Text (MyST)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "The two formats can be converted to each other, so the choice is up to you.\n",
    "Having said that, it's important to know that MyST is\n",
    "[common markdown compliant](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/reference.html#commonmark-block-tokens).\n",
    "If you intend to add a new document, we recommend starting from an `.md` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ray documentation also fully supports executable formats like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "Many of our examples are notebooks with [MyST markdown cells](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "In fact, this very document you're reading _is_ a notebook.\n",
    "You can check this for yourself by either downloading the `.ipynb` file,\n",
    "or directly launching this notebook into either Binder or Google Colab in the top navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to contribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take Ray Tune as an example, you can see that our documentation is made up of several types of documentation,\n",
    "all of which you can contribute to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [a project landing page](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html),\n",
    "- [a getting started guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/getting-started.html),\n",
    "- [a key concepts page](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/key-concepts.html),\n",
    "- [user guides for key features](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/tutorials/overview.html),\n",
    "- [practical examples](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/index.html),\n",
    "- [a detailed FAQ](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/faq.html),\n",
    "- [and API references](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api/api.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure is reflected in the\n",
    "[Ray documentation source code](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/doc/source/tune) as well, so you\n",
    "should have no problem finding what you're looking for.\n",
    "All other Ray projects share a similar structure, but depending on the project there might be minor differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of documentation listed above has its own purpose, but at the end our documentation\n",
    "comes down to _two types_ of documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Markup documents, written in MyST or rST. If you don't have a lot of (executable) code to contribute or\n",
    "  use more complex features such as\n",
    "  [tabbed content blocks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html#starting-ray), this is the right\n",
    "  choice. Most of the documents in Ray Tune are written in this way, for instance the\n",
    "  [key concepts](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/key-concepts.rst) or\n",
    "  [API documentation](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/api/api.rst).\n",
    "- Notebooks, written in `.ipynb` format. All Tune examples are written as notebooks. These notebooks render in\n",
    "  the browser like `.md` or `.rst` files, but have the added benefit of adding launch buttons to the top of the\n",
    "  document, so that users can run the code themselves in either Binder or Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing typos and improving explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you spot a typo in any document, or think that an explanation is not clear enough, please consider\n",
    "opening a pull request.\n",
    "In this scenario, just run the linter as described above and submit your pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding API references\n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Sphinx's autodoc extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to generate\n",
    "our API documentation from our source code.\n",
    "In case we're missing a reference to a function or class, please consider adding it to the respective document in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's how you can add a function or class reference using `autofunction` and `autoclass`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    ".. autofunction:: ray.tune.integration.docker.DockerSyncer\n",
    "\n",
    ".. autoclass:: ray.tune.integration.keras.TuneReportCallback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above snippet was taken from the\n",
    "[Tune API documentation](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/doc/source/tune/api/integration.rst),\n",
    "which you can look at for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change the content of the API documentation, you will have to edit the respective function or class\n",
    "signatures directly in the source code.\n",
    "For example, in the above `autofunction` call, to change the API reference for `ray.tune.integration.docker.DockerSyncer`,\n",
    "you would have to [change the following source file](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/7f1bacc7dc9caf6d0ec042e39499bbf1d9a7d065/python/ray/tune/integration/docker.py#L15-L38).\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the usage of APIs, it is important to have small usage examples embedded in the API documentation. These should be self-contained and run out of the box, so a user can copy and paste them into a Python interpreter and play around with them (e.g., if applicable, they should point to example data). Users often rely on these examples to build their applications. To learn more about writing examples, read [How to write code snippets](writing-code-snippets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding code to an `.rST` or `.md` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying text in an existing documentation file is easy, but you need to be careful when it comes to adding code.\n",
    "The reason is that we want to ensure every code snippet on our documentation is tested.\n",
    "This requires us to have a process for including and testing code snippets in documents. To learn how to write testable code \n",
    "snippets, read [How to write code snippets](writing-code-snippets).\n"

    "\n",
    "1. If it doesn’t already exist, create a directory for your team in \n",
    "`.vale/styles/Vocab`. For example, `.vale/styles/Vocab/Data`.\n",
    "2. If it doesn’t already exist, create a text file named `accept.txt`. For example, \n",
    "`.vale/styles/Vocab/Data/accept.txt`.\n",
    "3. Add your term to `accept.txt`. Vale accepts Regex.\n",

    "For more information, see [Vocabularies](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/vocab/) in the Vale \n",
    "documentation.\n",

    "### How to handle false Google.WordList errors\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use the word anyway, modify the appropriate field in the [WordList configuration](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/81c169bde2414fe4237f3d2f05fc76fccfd52dee/.vale/styles/Google/WordList.yml#L41).\n",

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run into a problem building the docs, following these steps can help isolate or eliminate most issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clean out build artifacts.** Use `make clean` to clean out docs build artifacts in the working directory. Sphinx uses caching to avoid doing work, and this sometimes causes problems. This is particularly true if you build the docs, then `git pull origin master` to pull in recent changes, and then try to build docs again.\n",
    "2. **Check your environment.** Use `pip list` to check the installed dependencies. Compare them to `doc/requirements-doc.txt`. The documentation build system doesn't have the same dependency requirements as Ray. You don't need to run ML models or execute code on distributed systems in order to build the docs. In fact, it's best to use a completely separate docs build environment from the environment you use to run Ray to avoid dependency conflicts.  When installing requirements, do `pip install -r doc/requirements-doc.txt`. Don't use `-U` because you don't want to upgrade any dependencies during the installation.\n",
    "3. **Ensure a modern version of Python.** The docs build system doesn't keep the same dependency and Python version requirements as Ray. Use a modern version of Python when building docs. Newer versions of Python can be substantially faster than preceding versions. Consult <https://endoflife.date/python> for the latest version support information.\n",
    "4. **Enable breakpoints in Sphinx**. Add -P to the `SPHINXOPTS` in `doc/Makefile` to tell `sphinx` to stop when it encounters a breakpoint, and remove `-j auto` to disable parallel builds. Now you can put breakpoints in the modules you're trying to import, or in `sphinx` code itself, which can help isolate build stubborn build issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where to go from here?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other ways to contribute to Ray other than documentation.\n",
    "See {ref}`our contributor guide <getting-involved>` for more information."
