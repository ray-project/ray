# Monitor Your Application

This section helps you debug and monitor your Serve applications by:

* viewing the Ray dashboard
* viewing the `serve status` output
* using Ray logging and Loki
* inspecting built-in Ray Serve metrics
* exporting metrics into Arize platform

## Ray Dashboard

You can use the Ray dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states.
This includes details such as:
* the number of deployment replicas currently running
* logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies
* the Ray nodes (i.e. machines) running in your Ray cluster.

You can access the Ray dashboard at port 8265 at your cluster's URI.
For example, if you're running Ray Serve locally, you can access the dashboard by going to `http://localhost:8265` in your browser.

View important information about your application by accessing the [Serve page](dash-serve-view).

```{image} https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/Images/master/docs/new-dashboard-v2/serve.png
:align: center
```

This example has a single-node cluster running a deployment named `Translator`. This deployment has 2 replicas.

View details of these replicas by browsing the Serve page. On the details page of each replica. From there, you can view metadata about the replica and the logs of the replicas, including the `logging` and `print` statements generated by the replica process.


Another useful view is the [Actors view](dash-actors-view). This example Serve application uses four [Ray actors](actor-guide):

- 1 Serve controller
- 1 HTTP proxy
- 2 `Translator` deployment replicas

You can see the details of these entities throughout the Serve page and in the actor's page.
This page includes additional useful information like each actor's process ID (PID) and a link to each actor's logs. You can also see whether any particular actor is alive or dead to help you debug potential cluster failures.

:::{tip}
To learn more about the Serve controller actor, the HTTP proxy actor(s), the deployment replicas, and how they all work together, check out the [Serve Architecture](serve-architecture) documentation.

For a detailed overview of the Ray dashboard, see the [dashboard documentation](observability-getting-started).

(serve-in-production-inspecting)=

## Inspect applications with the Serve CLI

Two Serve CLI commands help you inspect a Serve application in production: `serve config` and `serve status`.
If you have a remote cluster, `serve config` and `serve status` also has an `--address/-a` argument to access the cluster. See [VM deployment](serve-in-production-remote-cluster) for more information on this argument.

`serve config` gets the latest config file that the Ray Cluster received. This config file represents the Serve application's goal state. The Ray Cluster constantly strives to reach and maintain this state by deploying deployments, and recovering failed replicas, and performing other relevant actions.

Using the `serve_config.yaml` example from [the production guide](production-config-yaml):

```console
$ ray start --head
$ serve deploy serve_config.yaml
...

$ serve config
name: default
route_prefix: /
import_path: text_ml:app
runtime_env:
  pip:
    - torch
    - transformers
deployments:
- name: Translator
  num_replicas: 1
  user_config:
    language: french
- name: Summarizer
  num_replicas: 1
```

`serve status` gets your Serve application's current status. This command reports the status of the `proxies` and the `applications` running on the Ray cluster.

`proxies` lists each proxy's status. Each proxy is identified by the node ID of the node that it runs on. A proxy has three possible statuses:
* `STARTING`: The proxy is starting up and is not yet ready to serve requests.
* `HEALTHY`: The proxy is capable of serving requests. It is behaving normally.
* `UNHEALTHY`: The proxy has failed its health-checks. It will be killed, and a new proxy will be started on that node.
* `DRAINING`: The proxy is healthy but is closed to new requests. It may contain pending requests that are still being processed.
* `DRAINED`: The proxy is closed to new requests. There are no pending requests.

`applications` contains a list of applications, their overall statuses, and their deployments' statuses. Each entry in `applications` maps an application's name to four fields:
* `status`: A Serve application has four possible overall statuses:
    * `"NOT_STARTED"`: No application has been deployed on this cluster.
    * `"DEPLOYING"`: The application is currently carrying out a `serve deploy` request. It is deploying new deployments or updating existing ones.
    * `"RUNNING"`: The application is at steady-state. It has finished executing any previous `serve deploy` requests, and is attempting to maintain the goal state set by the latest `serve deploy` request.
    * `"DEPLOY_FAILED"`: The latest `serve deploy` request has failed.
* `message`: Provides context on the current status.
* `deployment_timestamp`: A UNIX timestamp of when Serve received the last `serve deploy` request. The timestamp is calculated using the `ServeController`'s local clock.
* `deployments`: A list of entries representing each deployment's status. Each entry maps a deployment's name to three fields:
    * `status`: A Serve deployment has three possible statuses:
        * `"UPDATING"`: The deployment is updating to meet the goal state set by a previous `deploy` request.
        * `"HEALTHY"`: The deployment achieved the latest requests goal state.
        * `"UNHEALTHY"`: The deployment has either failed to update, or has updated and has become unhealthy afterwards. This condition may be due to an error in the deployment's constructor, a crashed replica, or a general system or machine error.
    * `replica_states`: A list of the replicas' states and the number of replicas in that state. Each replica has five possible states:
        * `STARTING`: The replica is starting and not yet ready to serve requests.
        * `UPDATING`: The replica is undergoing a `reconfigure` update.
        * `RECOVERING`: The replica is recovering its state.
        * `RUNNING`: The replica is running normally and able to serve requests.
        * `STOPPING`: The replica is being stopped.
    * `message`: Provides context on the current status.

Use the `serve status` command to inspect your deployments after they are deployed and throughout their lifetime.

Using the `serve_config.yaml` example from [an earlier section](production-config-yaml):

```console
$ ray start --head
$ serve deploy serve_config.yaml
...

$ serve status
proxies:
  cef533a072b0f03bf92a6b98cb4eb9153b7b7c7b7f15954feb2f38ec: HEALTHY
applications:
  default:
    status: RUNNING
    message: ''
    last_deployed_time_s: 1694041157.2211847
    deployments:
      Translator:
        status: HEALTHY
        replica_states:
          RUNNING: 1
        message: ''
      Summarizer:
        status: HEALTHY
        replica_states:
          RUNNING: 1
        message: ''
```

For Kubernetes deployments with KubeRay, tighter integrations of `serve status` with Kubernetes are available. See [Getting the status of Serve applications in Kubernetes](serve-getting-status-kubernetes).

## Get application details in Python

Call the `serve.status()` API to get Serve application details in Python. `serve.status()` returns the same information as the `serve status` CLI command inside a `dataclass`. Use this method inside a deployment or a Ray driver script to obtain live information about the Serve applications on the Ray cluster. For example, this `monitoring_app` reports all the `RUNNING` Serve applications on the cluster:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/monitor_deployment.py
:start-after: __monitor_start__
:end-before: __monitor_end__
:language: python
```

(serve-logging)=
## Ray logging

To understand system-level behavior and to surface application-level details during runtime, you can leverage Ray logging.

Ray Serve uses Python's standard `logging` module with a logger named `"ray.serve"`.
By default, logs are emitted from actors both to `stderr` and on disk on each node at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`.
This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.

In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program (the Python script that calls `serve.run()` or the `serve run` CLI command), so it's convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.

For example, let's run a basic Serve application and view the logs that it emits.

First, let's create a simple deployment that logs a custom log message when it's queried:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/monitoring.py
:start-after: __start__
:end-before: __end__
:language: python
```

Run this deployment using the `serve run` CLI command:

```console
$ serve run monitoring:say_hello

2023-04-10 15:57:32,100	INFO scripts.py:380 -- Deploying from import path: "monitoring:say_hello".
[2023-04-10 15:57:33]  INFO ray._private.worker::Started a local Ray instance. View the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265 
(ServeController pid=63503) INFO 2023-04-10 15:57:35,822 controller 63503 deployment_state.py:1168 - Deploying new version of deployment SayHello.
(ProxyActor pid=63513) INFO:     Started server process [63513]
(ServeController pid=63503) INFO 2023-04-10 15:57:35,882 controller 63503 deployment_state.py:1386 - Adding 1 replica to deployment SayHello.
2023-04-10 15:57:36,840	SUCC scripts.py:398 -- Deployed Serve app successfully.
```

`serve run` prints a few log messages immediately. Note that a few of these messages start with identifiers such as

```
(ServeController pid=63881)
```

These messages are logs from Ray Serve [actors](actor-guide). They describe which actor (Serve controller, proxy, or deployment replica) created the log and what its process ID is (which is useful when distinguishing between different deployment replicas or proxies). The rest of these log messages are the actual log statements generated by the actor.

While `serve run` is running, we can query the deployment in a separate terminal window:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/
```

This causes the HTTP proxy and deployment replica to print log statements to the terminal running `serve run`:

```console
(ServeReplica:SayHello pid=63520) INFO 2023-04-10 15:59:45,403 SayHello SayHello#kTBlTj HzIYOzaEgN / monitoring.py:16 - Hello world!
(ServeReplica:SayHello pid=63520) INFO 2023-04-10 15:59:45,403 SayHello SayHello#kTBlTj HzIYOzaEgN / replica.py:527 - __CALL__ OK 0.5ms
```

:::{note}
Log messages include the logging level, timestamp, deployment name, replica tag, request ID, route, file name, and line number.
:::

Find a copy of these logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or [Loki](serve-logging-loki) to be able to search by deployment or replica.

Serve supports [Log Rotation](log-rotation) of these logs through setting the environment variables `RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES` and `RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT`.

To silence the replica-level logs or otherwise configure logging, configure the `"ray.serve"` logger **inside the deployment constructor**:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("ray.serve")

@serve.deployment
class Silenced:
    def __init__(self):
        logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
```

This controls which logs are written to STDOUT or files on disk.
In addition to the standard Python logger, Serve supports custom logging. Custom logging lets you control what messages are written to STDOUT/STDERR, files on disk, or both.

For a detailed overview of logging in Ray, see [Ray Logging](configure-logging).

### Configure Serve logging
From ray 2.9, the logging_config API configures logging for Ray Serve. You can configure logging for Ray Serve. Pass a dictionary of [LOGGING_CONFIG](../serve/api/doc/ray.serve.schema.LoggingConfig.rst) or object of [LOGGING_CONFIG](../serve/api/doc/ray.serve.schema.LoggingConfig.rst) to the `logging_config` argument of `serve.run` or `@serve.deployment`.

#### Configure logging format
You can configure the JSON logging format by passing `encoding=JSON` to `logging_config` argument of `@serve.deployment`. For example:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/logging_config.py
:start-after: __json_start__
:end-before: __json_end__
:language: python
```
In the `Model` log file, you should see the following:

```
{"levelname": "INFO", "asctime": "2023-12-07 12:59:45,271", "deployment": "Model", "replica": "default#Model#PUGBSJ", "request_id": "8d316c3b-4c9f-4769-8080-b6867ca46d1e", "route": "/", "application": "default", "message": "replica.py:719 - Started executing request 8d316c3b-4c9f-4769-8080-b6867ca46d1e"}
{"levelname": "INFO", "asctime": "2023-12-07 12:59:45,271", "deployment": "Model", "replica": "default#Model#PUGBSJ", "request_id": "8d316c3b-4c9f-4769-8080-b6867ca46d1e", "route": "/", "application": "default", "message": "replica.py:745 - __CALL__ OK 0.1ms"}
```

#### Disable access log

:::{note}
Access log is Ray Serve traffic log, it is printed to proxy log files and replica log files per request. Sometimes it is useful for debugging, but it can also be noisy.
:::

You can also disable the access log by passing `disable_access_log=True` to `logging_config` argument of `@serve.deployment`. For example:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/logging_config.py
:start-after: __enable_access_log_start__
:end-before:  __enable_access_log_end__
:language: python
```

The `Model` replica log file doesn't include the Serve traffic log, you should only see the application log in the log file.

```
INFO 2023-12-07 13:15:07,979 Model default#Model#LhNrRV 8c5fcdb2-87a0-46ed-b2f8-9336280c9c3d / default logging_config.py:50 - hello world
```

#### Configure logging in different deployments and applications
You can also configure logging at the application level by passing `logging_config` to `serve.run`. For example:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/logging_config.py
:start-after: __application_and_deployment_start__
:end-before:  __application_and_deployment_end__
:language: python
```

In the Router log file, you should see the following:

```
INFO 2023-12-07 14:18:18,811 Router default#Router#iNdKWL 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884 / default replica.py:719 - Started executing request 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884
DEBUG 2023-12-07 14:18:18,811 Router default#Router#iNdKWL 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884 / default logging_config.py:68 - This debug message is from the router.
```

In the Model log file, you should see the following:

```
INFO 2023-12-07 14:18:18,821 Model default#Model#AHYvjY 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884 / default replica.py:719 - Started executing request 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884
DEBUG 2023-12-07 14:18:18,821 Model default#Model#AHYvjY 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884 / default logging_config.py:75 - This debug message is from the model.
INFO 2023-12-07 14:18:18,821 Model default#Model#AHYvjY 6fe398fa-17d6-4abe-8264-d69c12aa9884 / default replica.py:745 - __CALL__ OK 0.1ms
```

When you set `logging_config` at the application level, Ray Serve applies to all deployments in the application. When you set `logging_config` at the deployment level at the same time, the deployment level configuration will overrides the application level configuration.

#### Configure logging for serve components
You can also update logging configuration similar above to the Serve controller and proxies by passing `logging_config` to `serve.start`.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/logging_config.py
:start-after: __configure_serve_component_start__
:end-before:  __configure_serve_component_end__
:language: python
```

### Set Request ID
You can set a custom request ID for each HTTP request by including `X-Request-ID` in the request header and retrieve request ID from response. For example

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/request_id.py
:language: python
```
The custom request ID `123-234` can be seen in the access logs that are printed to the HTTP Proxy log files and deployment log files.

HTTP proxy log file:
```
INFO 2023-07-20 13:47:54,221 http_proxy 127.0.0.1 123-234 / default http_proxy.py:538 - GET 200 8.9ms
```

Deployment log file:
```
(ServeReplica:default_Model pid=84006) INFO 2023-07-20 13:47:54,218 default_Model default_Model#yptKoo 123-234 / default replica.py:691 - __CALL__ OK 0.2ms
```

### Filtering logs with Loki

You can explore and filter your logs using [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/).
Setup and configuration are straightforward on Kubernetes, but as a tutorial, let's set up Loki manually.

For this walkthrough, you need both Loki and Promtail, which are both supported by [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com). Follow the installation instructions at Grafana's website to get executables for [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/) and [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/).
For convenience, save the Loki and Promtail executables in the same directory, and then navigate to this directory in your terminal.

Now let's get your logs into Loki using Promtail.

Save the following file as `promtail-local-config.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: ray
    static_configs:
      - labels:
        job: ray
        __path__: /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/*.*
```

The relevant part for Ray Serve is the `static_configs` field, where we have indicated the location of our log files with `__path__`.
The expression `*.*` will match all files, but it won't match directories since they cause an error with Promtail.

We'll run Loki locally.  Grab the default config file for Loki with the following command in your terminal:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/loki/v2.1.0/cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
```

Now start Loki:

```shell
./loki-darwin-amd64 -config.file=loki-local-config.yaml
```

Here you may need to replace `./loki-darwin-amd64` with the path to your Loki executable file, which may have a different name depending on your operating system.

Start Promtail and pass in the path to the config file we saved earlier:

```shell
./promtail-darwin-amd64 -config.file=promtail-local-config.yaml
```

Once again, you may need to replace `./promtail-darwin-amd64` with your Promtail executable.

Run the following Python script to deploy a basic Serve deployment with a Serve deployment logger and to make some requests:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/deployment_logger.py
:start-after: __start__
:end-before: __end__
:language: python
```

Now [install and run Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, where you can log in with default credentials:

* Username: admin
* Password: admin

On the welcome page, click "Add your first data source" and click "Loki" to add Loki as a data source.

Now click "Explore" in the left-side panel.  You are ready to run some queries!

To filter all these Ray logs for the ones relevant to our deployment, use the following [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/) query:

```shell
{job="ray"} |= "Counter"
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```{image} https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/Images/master/docs/serve/loki-serve.png
:align: center
```

You can use Loki to filter your Ray Serve logs and gather insights quicker.

(serve-production-monitoring-metrics)=

## Built-in Ray Serve metrics

You can leverage built-in Ray Serve metrics to get a closer look at your application's performance.

Ray Serve exposes important system metrics like the number of successful and
failed requests through the [Ray metrics monitoring infrastructure](dash-metrics-view). By default, the metrics are exposed in Prometheus format on each node.

:::{note}
Different metrics are collected when Deployments are called
via Python `DeploymentHandle` and when they are called via HTTP.

See the list of metrics below marked for each.

[†] - developer metrics for advanced usage; may change in future releases

To see this in action, first run the following command to start Ray and set up the metrics export port:

```bash
ray start --head --metrics-export-port=8080
```

Then run the following script:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/metrics_snippet.py
:start-after: __start__
:end-before: __end__
:language: python
```

The requests loop until canceled with `Control-C`.

While this script is running, go to `localhost:8080` in your web browser.
In the output there, you can search for `serve_` to locate the metrics above.
The metrics are updated once every ten seconds, so you need to refresh the page to see new values.

For example, after running the script for some time and refreshing `localhost:8080` you should find metrics similar to the following:

```
ray_serve_deployment_processing_latency_ms_count{..., replica="sleeper#jtzqhX"} 48.0
ray_serve_deployment_processing_latency_ms_sum{..., replica="sleeper#jtzqhX"} 48160.6719493866
```

which indicates that the average processing latency is just over one second, as expected.

You can even define a [custom metric](application-level-metrics) for your deployment and tag it with deployment or replica metadata.
Here's an example:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/monitoring/custom_metric_snippet.py
:start-after: __start__
:end-before: __end__
```

The emitted logs include:

```
# HELP ray_my_counter The number of odd-numbered requests to this deployment.
# TYPE ray_my_counter gauge
ray_my_counter{..., deployment="MyDeployment",model="123",replica="MyDeployment#rUVqKh"} 5.0
```

See the [Ray Metrics documentation](collect-metrics) for more details, including instructions for scraping these metrics using Prometheus.

## Profiling memory

Ray provides two useful metrics to track memory usage: `ray_component_rss_mb` (resident set size) and `ray_component_mem_shared_bytes` (shared memory). Approximate a Serve actor's memory usage by subtracting its shared memory from its resident set size (i.e. `ray_component_rss_mb` - `ray_component_mem_shared_bytes`).

If you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, use `memray` to debug (`pip install memray`). Set the env var `RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PROFILING=1`, and run your Serve application. All the Serve actors will run a `memray` tracker that logs their memory usage to `bin` files in the `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` directory. Run the `memray flamegraph [bin file]` command to generate a flamegraph of the memory usage. See the [memray docs](https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/overview.html) for more info.

## Exporting metrics into Arize
Besides using Prometheus to check out Ray metrics, Ray Serve also has the flexibility to export the metrics into other observability platforms.

[Arize](https://docs.arize.com/arize/) is a machine learning observability platform which can help you to monitor real-time model performance, root cause model failures/performance degradation using explainability & slice analysis and surface drift, data quality, data consistency issues etc.

To integrate with Arize, add Arize client code directly into your Serve deployment code. ([Example code](https://docs.arize.com/arize/integrations/integrations/anyscale-ray-serve))
