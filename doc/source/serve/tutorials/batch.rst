Batching Tutorial
=================

In this guide, we will deploy a simple vectorized adder that takes
a batch of queries and adds them at once. In particular, we show:

- How to implement and deploy a Ray Serve backend that accepts batches.
- How to configure the batch size.
- How to query the model in Python.

This tutorial should help the following use cases:

- You want to perform offline batch inference on a cluster of machines.
- You want to serve online queries and your model can take advantage of batching.
  For example, linear regressions and neural networks use CPU and GPU's
  vectorized instructions to perform computation in parallel. Performing
  inference with batching can increase the *throughput* of the model as well as
  *utilization* of the hardware.


Let's import Ray Serve and some other helpers.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../python/ray/serve/examples/doc/tutorial_batch.py
    :start-after: __doc_import_begin__
    :end-before: __doc_import_end__

You can use the ``@serve.batch`` decorator to annotate a function or a method.
This annotation will automatically cause calls to the function to be batched together.
The function must handle a list of objects and will be called with a single object.
This function must also be ``async def`` so that you can handle multiple queries concurrently:

.. code-block:: python

    @serve.batch
    async def my_batch_handler(self, requests: List):
        pass

This batch handler can then be called from another ``async def`` method in your backend.
These calls will be batched and executed together, but return an individual result as if
they were a normal function call:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyBackend:
        @serve.batch
        async def my_batch_handler(self, requests: List):
            results = []
            for request in requests:
                results.append(request.json())
            return results

        async def __call__(self, request):
            await self.my_batch_handler(request)

.. note::
    By default, Ray Serve performs *opportunistic batching*. This means that as
    soon as the batch handler is called, the method will be executed without
    waiting for a full batch. If there are more queries available after this call
    finishes, a larger batch may be executed. This behavior can be tuned using the
    ``batch_wait_timeout_s`` option to ``@serve.batch`` (defaults to 0). Increasing this
    timeout may improve throughput at the cost of latency under low load.

Let's define a backend that takes in a list of requests, extracts the input value,
converts them into an array, and uses NumPy to add 1 to each element.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../python/ray/serve/examples/doc/tutorial_batch.py
    :start-after: __doc_define_servable_begin__
    :end-before: __doc_define_servable_end__

Let's deploy it. Note that in the ``@serve.batch`` decorator, we are specifying
specifying the maximum batch size via ``max_batch_size=4``. This option limits
the maximum possible batch size that will be executed at once.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../python/ray/serve/examples/doc/tutorial_batch.py
    :start-after: __doc_deploy_begin__
    :end-before: __doc_deploy_end__

Let's define a :ref:`Ray remote task<ray-remote-functions>` to send queries in
parallel. As you can see, the first batch has a batch size of 1, and the subsequent
queries have a batch size of 4. Even though each query is issued independently,
Ray Serve was able to evaluate them in batches.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../python/ray/serve/examples/doc/tutorial_batch.py
    :start-after: __doc_query_begin__
    :end-before: __doc_query_end__

What if you want to evaluate a whole batch in Python? Ray Serve allows you to send
queries via the Python API. A batch of queries can either come from the web server
or the Python API. Requests coming from the Python API will have a similar API
to Starlette Request. See more on the API :ref:`here<serve-handle-explainer>`.

To query the backend via Python API, we can use ``serve.get_handle`` to receive
a handle to the corresponding "endpoint". To enqueue a query, you can call
``handle.remote(data)``. This call returns immediately
with a :ref:`Ray ObjectRef<ray-object-refs>`. You can call `ray.get` to retrieve
the result.

    :start-after: __doc_query_handle_begin__
    :end-before: __doc_query_handle_end__
