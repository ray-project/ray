A small LLM runs on a single node with 1â€“2 GPUs, making it fast, inexpensive, and simple to use. Itâ€™s ideal for prototyping, lightweight applications, latency-critical use cases, cost-sensitive deployments, and environments with limited resources where efficiency matters more than peak accuracy.


For larger models, see [Deploy a medium-sized LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/medium-size-llm/README.html) or [Deploy a large-sized LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/large-size-llm/README.html).

## Configure Ray Serve LLM

Ray Serve LLM provides multiple [Python APIs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/index.html#llm-api) for defining your application. Use [`build_openai_app`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.llm.build_openai_app.html#ray.serve.llm.build_openai_app) to build a full application from your [`LLMConfig`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.llm.LLMConfig.html#ray.serve.llm.LLMConfig) object.

Set your Hugging Face token in the config file to access gated models like `Llama-3.1`.


```python
# serve_llama_3_1_8b.py
from ray.serve.llm import LLMConfig, build_openai_app
import os

llm_config = LLMConfig(
    model_loading_config=dict(
        model_id="my-llama-3.1-8b",
        # Or unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for an ungated model
        model_source="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    ),
    accelerator_type="L4",
    deployment_config=dict(
        autoscaling_config=dict(
            min_replicas=1,
            max_replicas=2,
        )
    ),
    ### If your model isn't gated, you can skip `HF_TOKEN`
    # Share your Hugging Face token with the vllm engine so it can access the gated Llama 3
    # Type `export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HUGGINGFACE-TOKEN>` in a terminal
    runtime_env=dict(env_vars={"HF_TOKEN": os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN")}),
    engine_kwargs=dict(max_model_len=8192),
)
app = build_openai_app({"llm_configs": [llm_config]})

```

**Note:** Before moving to a production setup, migrate to using a [Serve config file](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/production-guide/config.html) to make your deployment version-controlled, reproducible, and easier to maintain for CI/CD pipelines. See [Serving LLMs - Quickstart Examples: Production Guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/quick-start.html#production-deployment) for an example.

---

## Deploy locally


**Prerequisites**

* Access to GPU compute.
* (Optional) A **Hugging Face token** if using gated models like Metaâ€™s Llama. Store it in `export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HUGGINGFACE-TOKEN>`.

**Note:** Depending on the organization, you can usually request access on the model's Hugging Face page. For example, Metaâ€™s Llama models approval can take anywhere from a few hours to several weeks.

**Dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install "ray[serve,llm]"
```

---

### Launch

Follow the instructions at [Configure Ray Serve LLM](#configure-ray-serve-llm) to define your app in a Python module `serve_llama_3_1_8b.py`.  

In a terminal, run:  


```bash
%%bash
export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HUGGINGFACE-TOKEN>
serve run serve_llama_3_1_8b:app --non-blocking
```

Deployment typically takes a few minutes as the cluster is provisioned, the vLLM server starts, and the model is downloaded. 

---

### Send requests

Your endpoint is available locally at `http://localhost:8000`. You can use a placeholder authentication token for the OpenAI client, for example `"FAKE_KEY"`.

Example curl:


```bash
%%bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer FAKE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "model": "my-llama-3.1-8b", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2 + 2?"}] }'
```

Example Python:


```python
#client.py
from urllib.parse import urljoin
from openai import OpenAI

API_KEY = "FAKE_KEY"
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

client = OpenAI(base_url=urljoin(BASE_URL, "v1"), api_key=API_KEY)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="my-llama-3.1-8b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
    if content:
        print(content, end="", flush=True)
```


---

### Shutdown

Shutdown your LLM service: 


```bash
%%bash
serve shutdown -y
```


---

## Deploy to production with Anyscale Services

For production deployment, use Anyscale Services to deploy the Ray Serve app to a dedicated cluster without modifying the code. Anyscale ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing, keeping the service resilient against node failures, high traffic, and rolling updates.

---

### Launch the service

Anyscale provides out-of-the-box images (`anyscale/ray-llm`) which come pre-loaded with Ray Serve LLM, vLLM, and all required GPU/runtime dependencies. This makes it easy to get started without building a custom image.

Create your Anyscale Service configuration in a new `service.yaml` file:

```yaml
# service.yaml
name: deploy-llama-3-8b
image_uri: anyscale/ray-llm:2.49.0-py311-cu128 # Anyscale Ray Serve LLM image. Use `containerfile: ./Dockerfile` to use a custom Dockerfile.
compute_config:
  auto_select_worker_config: true 
working_dir: .
cloud:
applications:
  # Point to your app in your Python module
  - import_path: serve_llama_3_1_8b:app
```


Deploy your service with the following command. Make sure to forward your Hugging Face token:


```bash
%%bash
anyscale service deploy -f service.yaml --env HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HUGGINGFACE-TOKEN>
```

**Custom Dockerfile**  
You can customize the container by building your own Dockerfile. In your Anyscale Service config, reference the Dockerfile with `containerfile` (instead of `image_uri`):

```yaml
# service.yaml
# Replace:
# image_uri: anyscale/ray-llm:2.49.0-py311-cu128

# with:
containerfile: ./Dockerfile
```

See the [Anyscale base images](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/base-images) for details on what each image includes.

---

### Send requests 

The `anyscale service deploy` command output shows both the endpoint and authentication token:
```console
(anyscale +3.9s) curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" <YOUR-ENDPOINT>
```
You can also retrieve both from the service page in the Anyscale Console. Click the **Query** button at the top. See [Send requests](#send-requests) for example requests, but make sure to use the correct endpoint and authentication token.  

---

### Access the Serve LLM dashboard

See [Enable LLM monitoring](#enable-llm-monitoring) for instructions on enabling LLM-specific logging. To open the Ray Serve LLM Dashboard from an Anyscale Service:
1. In the Anyscale console, go to your **Service** or **Workspace**.
2. Navigate to the **Metrics** tab.
3. Expand **View in Grafana** and click **Serve LLM Dashboard**.

---

### Shutdown

Shutdown your Anyscale Service:


```bash
%%bash
anyscale service terminate -n deploy-llama-3-8b
```


---

## Enable LLM monitoring

The *Serve LLM Dashboard* offers deep visibility into model performance, latency, and system behavior, including:

- Token throughput (tokens/sec).
- Latency metrics: Time To First Token (TTFT), Time Per Output Token (TPOT).
- KV cache utilization.

To enable these metrics, go to your LLM config and set `log_engine_metrics: true`. Ensure vLLM V1 is active with `VLLM_USE_V1: "1"`.

**Note:** `VLLM_USE_V1: "1"` is the default value with `ray >= 2.48.0` and can be omitted.
```yaml
applications:
- ...
  args:
    llm_configs:
      - ...
        runtime_env:
          env_vars:
            VLLM_USE_V1: "1"
        ...
        log_engine_metrics: true
```

---

## Improve concurrency

Ray Serve LLM uses [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) as its backend engine, which logs the *maximum concurrency* it can support based on your configuration.

Example log:
```console
INFO 08-06 20:15:53 [executor_base.py:118] Maximum concurrency for 8192 tokens per request: 3.53x
```

You can improve concurrency depending on your model and hardware in several ways:  

**Reduce `max_model_len`**  
Lowering `max_model_len` reduces the memory needed for KV cache.

**Example:** Running *llama-3.1-8&nbsp;B* on an A10G or L4 GPU:
- `max_model_len = 8192` â†’ concurrency â‰ˆ 3.5
- `max_model_len = 4096` â†’ concurrency â‰ˆ 7

**Use Quantized Models**  
Quantizing your model (for example, to FP8) reduces the model's memory footprint, freeing up memory for more KV cache and enabling more concurrent requests.

**Use Tensor Parallelism**  
Distribute the model across multiple GPUs with `tensor_parallel_size > 1`.

**Note:** Latency may rise if GPUs donâ€™t have strong GPU interconnect like NVLink.

**Upgrade to GPUs with more memory**  
Some GPUs provide significantly more room for KV cache and allow for higher concurrency out of the box.

**Scale with more Replicas**  
In addition to tuning per-replica concurrency, you can scale *horizontally* by increasing the number of replicas in your config.  
Raising the replica count increases the total number of concurrent requests your service can handle, especially under sustained or bursty traffic.
```yaml
deployment_config:
  autoscaling_config:
    min_replicas: 1
    max_replicas: 4
```

*For more details on tuning strategies, hardware guidance, and serving configurations, see [Choose a GPU for LLM serving](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/serving/gpu-guidance) and [Tune parameters for LLMs on Anyscale services](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/serving/parameter-tuning).*

## Troubleshooting

**Hugging Face authentication errors**  
Some models, such as Llama-3.1, are gated and require prior authorization from the organization. See your modelâ€™s documentation for instructions on obtaining access.

**Out-of-memory errors**  
Out-of-memory (OOM) errors are one of the most common failure modes when deploying LLMs, especially as model sizes and context length increase.  
See this [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.anyscale.com/overview) for common errors and how to fix them.
