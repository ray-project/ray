    "\n",
    "Ray Serve LLM uses [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) as its backend engine, which logs the *maximum concurrency* it can support based on your configuration.\n",

    "Example log:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "INFO 08-06 20:15:53 [executor_base.py:118] Maximum concurrency for 8192 tokens per request: 3.53x\n",
    "```\n",

    "You can improve concurrency depending on your model and hardware in several ways:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduce `max_model_len`**  \n",
    "Lowering `max_model_len` reduces the memory needed for KV cache.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `max_model_len = 8192` → concurrency ≈ 3.5\n",
    "- `max_model_len = 4096` → concurrency ≈ 7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Quantized Models**  \n",
    "Quantizing your model (for example, to FP8) reduces the model's memory footprint, freeing up memory for more KV cache and enabling more concurrent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Tensor Parallelism**  \n",
    "Distribute the model across multiple GPUs with `tensor_parallel_size > 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Latency may rise if GPUs don’t have strong GPU interconnect like NVLink.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upgrade to GPUs with more memory**  \n",
    "Some GPUs provide significantly more room for KV cache and allow for higher concurrency out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale with more Replicas**  \n",
    "In addition to tuning per-GPU concurrency, you can scale *horizontally* by increasing the number of replicas in your config.  \n",
    "Each replica runs on its own GPU, so raising the replica count increases the total number of concurrent requests your service can handle, especially under sustained or bursty traffic.\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "deployment_config:\n",
    "  autoscaling_config:\n",
    "    min_replicas: 1\n",
    "    max_replicas: 4\n",
