    "```console\n",
    "INFO 08-06 20:15:53 [executor_base.py:118] Maximum concurrency for 8192 tokens per request: 3.53x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve concurrency depending on your model and hardware in several ways:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduce `max_model_len`**  \n",
    "Lowering `max_model_len` reduces the memory needed for KV cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Running *llama-3.1-8&nbsp;B* on an A10G or L4 GPU:\n",
    "- `max_model_len = 8192` → concurrency ≈ 3.5\n",
    "- `max_model_len = 4096` → concurrency ≈ 7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Quantized Models**  \n",
    "Quantizing your model (for example, to FP8) reduces the model's memory footprint, freeing up memory for more KV cache and enabling more concurrent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Tensor Parallelism**  \n",
    "Distribute the model across multiple GPUs with `tensor_parallel_size > 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Latency may rise if GPUs don't have strong GPU interconnect such as NVLink.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upgrade to GPUs with more memory**  \n",
    "Some GPUs provide significantly more room for KV cache and allow for higher concurrency out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale with more Replicas**  \n",
    "In addition to tuning per-replica concurrency, you can scale *horizontally* by increasing the number of replicas in your config.  \n",
    "Raising the replica count increases the total number of concurrent requests your service can handle, especially under sustained or bursty traffic.\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "deployment_config:\n",
    "  autoscaling_config:\n",
    "    min_replicas: 1\n",
    "    max_replicas: 4\n",
