    "A hybrid reasoning model provides flexibility by allowing you to enable or disable reasoning as needed. You can use structured, step-by-step thinking for complex queries while skipping it for simpler ones, balancing accuracy with efficiency depending on the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Hybrid reasoning models* are reasoning-capable models that allow you to toggle the thinking process on and off. You can enable structured, step-by-step reasoning when needed but skip it for simpler queries to reduce latency. Purely reasoning models always apply their reasoning behavior, while hybrid models give you fine-grained control over when to use reasoning.\n",

    "| **Thinking OFF** | Direct answer generation                   | Casual queries, short instructions, single-step answers              | May struggle with complex reasoning or interpretability. |\n",
    "<!-- vale Google.Acronyms = YES -->\n",
    "**Note:** Reasoning often benefits from long context windows (32K up to +1M tokens), high token throughput, low-temperature decoding (greedy sampling), and strong instruction tuning or scratchpad-style reasoning.\n",

    "<!-- vale Vale.Terms = YES -->\n",

    "- Complex, multi-step tasks that require reasoning, such as math, physics, or logic problems.\n",
    "- Ambiguous queries or situations with incomplete information.\n",
    "- Planning, workflow orchestration, or when the model needs to act as an \"agent\" coordinating other tools or models.\n",
    "- Analyzing intricate data, images, or charts.\n",
    "- In-depth code reviews or evaluating outputs from other AI systems (LLM as Judge approach).\n",

    "### How to enable or disable thinking mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Toggle thinking mode varies by model and framework. Consult the documentation for the model to see how it structures and controls thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to [control reasoning in Qwen-3](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-32B#switching-between-thinking-and-non-thinking-mode), you can:\n",
    "* Add `\"/think\"` or `\"/no_think\"` in the prompt.\n",
    "* Set `enable_thinking` in the request:\n",
    "  `extra_body={\"chat_template_kwargs\": {\"enable_thinking\": ...}}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Send request with thinking enabled](#send-request-with-thinking-enabled) or [Send request with thinking disabled](#send-request-with-thinking-disabled) for practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parse reasoning outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In thinking mode, hybrid models often separate _reasoning_ from the _final answer_ using tags like `<think>...</think>`. Without a proper parser, this reasoning may end up in the `content` field instead of the dedicated `reasoning_content` field.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that Ray Serve LLM correctly parses the reasoning output, configure a `reasoning_parser` in your Ray Serve LLM deployment. This tells vLLM how to isolate the model’s thought process from the rest of the output.\n",
    "**Note:** For example, *Qwen-3* uses the `qwen3` parser. See the [vLLM docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/reasoning_outputs.html#supported-models) or your model's documentation to find a supported parser, or [build your own](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/reasoning_outputs.html#how-to-support-a-new-reasoning-model) if needed.\n",
