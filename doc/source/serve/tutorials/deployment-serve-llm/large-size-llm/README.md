A large LLM typically runs on multiple nodes with multiple GPUs, prioritizing peak quality and capability: stronger reasoning, broader knowledge, longer context windows, more robust generalization. When higher latency, complexity, and cost are acceptable trade-offs because you require state-of-the-art results.

This tutorial deploys DeepSeek-R1, a large LLM with 685&nbsp;B parameters, using Ray Serve LLM. For smaller models, see [Deploying a small-sized LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/small-size-llm/README.html) or [Deploying a medium-sized LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/medium-size-llm/README.html).

## Challenges of large-scale deployments

Deploying a 685&nbsp;B-parameter model like DeepSeek-R1 presents significant technical challenges. At this scale, the model can't fit on a single GPU or even a single node. You must distribute it across multiple GPUs and nodes using *tensor parallelism* (splitting tensors within each layer) and *pipeline parallelism* (spreading layers across devices).  

Deploying a model of this scale normally requires you to manually launch and coordinate multiple nodes, unless you use a managed platform like [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/), which automates cluster scaling and node orchestration. See [Deploy to production with Anyscale Services](#deploy-to-production-with-anyscale-services) for more details.

---

## Configure Ray Serve LLM

A large-sized LLM is typically deployed across multiple nodes with multiple GPUs. To fully utilize the hardware, set `pipeline_parallel_size` to the number of nodes and `tensor_parallel_size` to the number of GPUs per node, which distributes the modelâ€™s weights evenly.

Ray Serve LLM provides multiple [Python APIs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/index.html#llm-api) for defining your application. Use [`build_openai_app`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.llm.build_openai_app.html#ray.serve.llm.build_openai_app) to build a full application from your [`LLMConfig`](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.llm.LLMConfig.html#ray.serve.llm.LLMConfig) object.

**Optional:** Because Deepseek-R1 is a reasoning model, this tutorial uses vLLMâ€™s built-in reasoning parser to correctly separate its reasoning content from the final response. See [Deploying a reasoning LLM: Parse reasoning outputs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/reasoning-llm/README.html#parse-reasoning-outputs).


```python
# serve_deepseek_r1.py
from ray.serve.llm import LLMConfig, build_openai_app

llm_config = LLMConfig(
    model_loading_config=dict(
        model_id="my-deepseek-r1",
        model_source="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    ),
    accelerator_type="H100",
    deployment_config=dict(
        autoscaling_config=dict(
            min_replicas=1,
            max_replicas=1,
        )
    ),
    ### Uncomment if your model is gated and needs your Hugging Face token to access it.
    # runtime_env=dict(env_vars={"HF_TOKEN": os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN")}),
    engine_kwargs=dict(
        max_model_len=16384,
        # Split weights among 8 GPUs in the node
        tensor_parallel_size=8,
        pipeline_parallel_size=2,
        reasoning_parser="deepseek_r1",  # Optional: separate reasoning content from the final answer
    ),
)

app = build_openai_app({"llm_configs": [llm_config]})

```

**Note:** Before moving to a production setup, migrate to a [Serve config file](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/production-guide/config.html) to make your deployment version-controlled, reproducible, and easier to maintain for CI/CD pipelines. See [Serving LLMs - Quickstart Examples: Production Guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/quick-start.html#production-deployment) for an example.

---

## Deploy locally

**Prerequisites**

* Access to GPU compute.
* (Optional) A **Hugging Face token** if using gated models. Store it in `export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HUGGINGFACE-TOKEN>`.

**Note:** Depending on the organization, you can usually request access on the model's Hugging Face page. For example, Metaâ€™s Llama models approval can take anywhere from a few hours to several weeks.

**Dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install "ray[serve,llm]"
```

**Beware**: this is an expensive deployment.

---

### Launch

Follow the instructions at [Configure Ray Serve LLM](#configure-ray-serve-llm) to define your app in a Python module `serve_deepseek_r1.py`.  

In a terminal, run:  


```bash
%%bash
serve run serve_deepseek_r1:app --non-blocking
```

Deployment typically takes a few minutes as the cluster is provisioned, the vLLM server starts, and the model is downloaded. 

---

### Send requests

Your endpoint is available locally at `http://localhost:8000` and you can use a placeholder authentication token for the OpenAI client, for example `"FAKE_KEY"`.

Example curl:


```bash
%%bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer FAKE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "model": "my-deepseek-r1", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2 + 2?"}] }'
```

Example Python:


```python
#client.py
from urllib.parse import urljoin
from openai import OpenAI

API_KEY = "FAKE_KEY"
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

client = OpenAI(base_url=urljoin(BASE_URL, "v1"), api_key=API_KEY)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="my-deepseek-r1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}],
    stream=True,
)

# Stream and print JSON
for chunk in response:
    # Stream reasoning content first
    if hasattr(chunk.choices[0].delta, "reasoning_content"):
        data_reasoning = chunk.choices[0].delta.reasoning_content
        if data_reasoning:
            print(data_reasoning, end="", flush=True)
    # Later, stream the final answer
    if hasattr(chunk.choices[0].delta, "content"):
        data_content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
        if data_content:
            print(data_content, end="", flush=True)
```


---

### Shutdown

Shutdown your LLM service: 


```bash
%%bash
serve shutdown -y
```


---

## Deploy to production with Anyscale services

For production deployment, use Anyscale services to deploy the Ray Serve app to a dedicated cluster without modifying the code. Anyscale provides scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing, keeping the service resilient against node failures, high traffic, and rolling updates, while also automating multi-node setup and autoscaling for large models like DeepSeek-R1.

**Beware**: this is an expensive deployment. At the time of writing, the deployment cost is around \$110 USD per hour in the `us-west-2` AWS region using on-demand instances. Because this node has a high amount of inter-node traffic, and cross-zone traffic is expensive (around \$0.02 per GB), it's recommended to *disable cross-zone autoscaling*. This demo is pre-configured with cross-zone autoscaling disabled for your convenience.

### Prerequisites

The following template runs only on H100 GPUs in your self-hosted Anyscale cloud, as H100s aren't available in Anyscaleâ€™s public cloud. This example uses two nodes of type *8xH100-80&nbsp;GB:208CPU-1830&nbsp;GB* on an AWS cloud.

To provision nodes with 1000 GB of disk capacity, see [Changing the default disk size for GCP clusters](https://docs.anyscale.com/configuration/compute/gcp#disk-size) for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or [Changing the default disk size for AWS clusters](https://docs.anyscale.com/configuration/compute/aws#disk-size) for Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

---

### Launch the service

Anyscale provides out-of-the-box images (`anyscale/ray-llm`), which come pre-loaded with Ray Serve LLM, vLLM, and all required GPU/runtime dependencies. This makes it easy to get started without building a custom image.

Create your Anyscale service configuration in a new `service.yaml` file:
```yaml
#service.yaml
name: deploy-deepseek-r1
image_uri: anyscale/ray-llm:2.49.0-py311-cu128 # Anyscale Ray Serve LLM image. Use `containerfile: ./Dockerfile` to use a custom Dockerfile.
compute_config:
  auto_select_worker_config: true 
  # Change default disk size to 1000GB
  advanced_instance_config:
    ## AWS ##
    BlockDeviceMappings:
      - Ebs:
        - VolumeSize: 1000
          VolumeType: gp3
          DeleteOnTermination: true
        DeviceName: "/dev/sda1"
    #########
    ## GCP ##
    #instanceProperties:
    #  disks:
    #    - boot: true
    #      auto_delete: true
    #      initialize_params:
    #        - disk_size_gb: 1000
    #########
  
working_dir: .
cloud:
applications:
# Point to your app in your Python module
- import_path: serve_deepseek_r1:app
```

Deploy your service


```bash
%%bash
anyscale service deploy -f service.yaml
```

**Note:** If your model is gated, make sure to pass your Hugging Face token to the service with `--env HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>`

**Custom Dockerfile**  
You can customize the container by building your own Dockerfile. In your Anyscale Service config, reference the Dockerfile with `containerfile` (instead of `image_uri`):

```yaml
# service.yaml
# Replace:
# image_uri: anyscale/ray-llm:2.49.0-py311-cu128

# with:
containerfile: ./Dockerfile
```

See the [Anyscale base images](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/base-images) for details on what each image includes.

---

### Send requests 

The `anyscale service deploy` command output shows both the endpoint and authentication token:
```console
(anyscale +3.9s) curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" <YOUR-ENDPOINT>
```
You can also retrieve both from the service page in the Anyscale console. Click the **Query** button at the top. See [Send requests](#send-requests) for example requests, but make sure to use the correct endpoint and authentication token.  

---

### Access the Serve LLM dashboard

See [Enable LLM monitoring](#enable-llm-monitoring) for instructions on enabling LLM-specific logging. To open the Ray Serve LLM dashboard from an Anyscale service:
1. In the Anyscale console, go to your **Service** or **Workspace**
2. Navigate to the **Metrics** tab
3. Click **View in Grafana** and click **Serve LLM Dashboard**

---

### Shutdown 
 
Shutdown your Anyscale service:


```bash
%%bash
anyscale service terminate -n deploy-deepseek-r1
```


---

## Enable LLM monitoring

The *Serve LLM dashboard* offers deep visibility into model performance, latency, and system behavior, including:

* Token throughput (tokens/sec)
* Latency metrics: Time To First Token (TTFT), Time Per Output Token (TPOT)
* KV cache utilization

To enable these metrics, go to your LLM config and set `log_engine_metrics: true`. Ensure vLLM V1 is active with `VLLM_USE_V1: "1"`. 
**Note:** `VLLM_USE_V1: "1"` is the default value with `ray >= 2.48.0` and can be omitted.
```yaml
applications:
- ...
  args:
    llm_configs:
      - ...
        runtime_env:
          env_vars:
            VLLM_USE_V1: "1"
        ...
        log_engine_metrics: true
```

---

## Improve concurrency

Ray Serve LLM uses [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) as its backend engine, which logs the *maximum concurrency* it can support based on your configuration.  

Example log:
```console
INFO 07-30 11:56:04 [kv_cache_utils.py:637] Maximum concurrency for 32,768 tokens per request: 29.06x
```

The following are a few ways to improve concurrency depending on your model and hardware:  

**Reduce `max_model_len`**  
Lowering `max_model_len` reduces the memory needed for KV cache.

**Example**: Running DeepSeek-R1 on 2 nodes with 8xH100-80&nbsp;GB GPUs each:
* `max_model_len = 32,768` â†’ concurrency â‰ˆ 29
* `max_model_len = 16,384` â†’ concurrency â‰ˆ 58

**Use distilled or quantized models**  
Quantizing or distilling your model reduces its memory footprint, freeing up space for more KV cache and enabling more concurrent requests. For example, see [`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) for a distilled version of DeepSeek-R1.


**Upgrade to GPUs with more memory**  
Some GPUs provide significantly more room for KV cache and allow for higher concurrency out of the box.

**Scale with more replicas**  
In addition to tuning per-replica concurrency, you can scale *horizontally* by increasing the number of replicas in your config.  
Raising the replica count increases the total number of concurrent requests your service can handle, especially under sustained or bursty traffic.
```yaml
deployment_config:
  autoscaling_config:
    min_replicas: 1
    max_replicas: 4
```

*For more details on tuning strategies, hardware guidance, and serving configurations, see [Choose a GPU for LLM serving](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/serving/gpu-guidance) and [Tune parameters for LLMs on Anyscale services](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/serving/parameter-tuning).*

---

## Troubleshooting

**Hugging Face auth errors**  
Some models, such as Llama-3.1, are gated and require prior authorization from the organization. See your modelâ€™s documentation for instructions on obtaining access.

**Out-Of-Memory errors**  
Outâ€‘ofâ€‘memory (OOM) errors are one of the most common failure modes when deploying LLMs, especially as model sizes, and context length increase.  
See [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.anyscale.com/overview) for common errors and how to fix them.
