# Deployment Graph Patterns

These are some common deployment graph patterns that can support complex workloads: 

- [Chain nodes with same class and different args](deployment-graph-patterns/chain_nodes_same_class_different_args.md)
- [Combine two nodes with passing same input in parallel](deployment-graph-patterns/combine_two_nodes_with_passing_input_parallel.md)
- [Control flow based on user inputs](deployment-graph-patterns/control_flow_based_on_user_inputs.md)
