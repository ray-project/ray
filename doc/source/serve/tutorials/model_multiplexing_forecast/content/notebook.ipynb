        "This tutorial shows you how to efficiently serve multiple forecasting models using Ray Serve's model multiplexing pattern. Model multiplexing lets you serve dozens or thousands of models from a shared pool of replicas, optimizing cost and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why model multiplexing for forecasting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Forecasting applications often require separate models per customer, team, or region. Standing up separate deployments for each model is expensive and wasteful. Model multiplexing solves this by:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sharing resources**: Multiple models use the same replica pool.\n",
        "- **Lazy loading**: Models load on-demand when first requested.\n",
        "- **Automatic caching**: Frequently used models stay in memory using Least Recently Used (LRU) policy.\n",
        "- **Intelligent routing**: Requests route to replicas that already have the model loaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "See [Model Multiplexing](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/model-multiplexing.html) for the core concepts and API reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use model multiplexing when you have:\n",
        "- Many models that can fit in memory.\n",
        "- Sparse access patterns (not all models queried constantly).\n",
        "- Similar input/output formats across models.\n",
        "- Limited infrastructure budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Write a multiplexed deployment\n",
