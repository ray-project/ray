# Building a Real-time Object Detection Service with Ray Serve

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a production-ready object detection service using Ray Serve. You will learn how to serve a YOLOv5 object detection model efficiently with automatic GPU resource management and scaling capabilities.


## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install "ray[serve]" requests torch pillow numpy opencv-python-headless pandas "gitpython>=3.1.30"
```

## Implementation

This example uses the [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model for object detection and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for creating the web API. 

### Code Structure

Save the following code to a file named `object_detection.py`:

```{literalinclude} ../doc_code/object_detection.py
:language: python
:start-after: __example_code_start__
:end-before: __example_code_end__
```

The code consists of two main deployments:
1. **APIIngress**: A FastAPI-based frontend that handles HTTP requests
2. **ObjectDetection**: The backend deployment that loads the YOLOv5 model and performs inference on GPU

:::{note}
**Understanding Autoscaling**

The configuration in this example sets `min_replicas` to 0, which means:
- The deployment starts with no `ObjectDetection` replicas
- Ray Serve creates replicas only when requests arrive
- After a period of inactivity, Ray Serve scales down the replicas back to 0
- This "scale-to-zero" capability helps conserve GPU resources when the service isn't being actively used
:::

## Deployment

Deploy the service with:

```bash
serve run object_detection:entrypoint
```

When successfully deployed, you should see log messages similar to:

```text

```



## Troubleshooting

:::{tip}
**Common OpenCV Error**

You might encounter this error when running the example:

```
ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

This typically happens when running `opencv-python` in headless environments like containers. The solution is to use the headless version:

```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python; pip install opencv-python-headless
```
:::

## Testing the Service

Once the service is running, you can test it with the following Python code:

```python
import requests

# Sample image URL for testing
image_url = "https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg"

# Send request to the object detection service
resp = requests.get(f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/detect?image_url={image_url}")

# Save the annotated image with detected objects
with open("output.jpeg", 'wb') as f:
    f.write(resp.content)
```

## Example Output

The service processes the image and returns it with bounding boxes around detected objects:
