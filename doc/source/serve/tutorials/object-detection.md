# Serving Object Detection Model
Build an object detection application with Ray Serve.

To run this example, you will need to install the following:

```bash
pip install "ray[serve]" requests torch
```

This example uses the [ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model and FastAPI. Save the following code to a file named object_detection.py.

Serve Code:
```{literalinclude} ../doc_code/object_detection.py
```

Use `serve run object_detection:entrypoint` to start the serve application.

:::{note}
The autoscaling config is using min_replica = 0, replica will be spawn when the request arrives. When there is no request, Serve Application will downscale replicas to 0 for saving GPU resource.

When `min_replica = 0` in the autoscaling configuration, the Serve application spawns a replica when a request arrives. If there are no requests, it downscales replicas to 0 to save GPU resources.

Use following code to send requests.
```python
import requests

image_url = "https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg"
resp = requests.get(f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/detect?image_url={image_url}")

with open("output.jpeg", 'wb') as f:
    f.write(resp.content)
```
