        "This tutorial shows you how to build a recommendation system using Ray Serve's model composition pattern. Model composition lets you break complex ML pipelines into independent deployments that scale and update separately.\n",

        "## Why model composition for recommendation systems?\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendation systems typically involve multiple stages: feature extraction, candidate generation, ranking, and filtering. Model composition solves common challenges by:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Independent scaling**: Scale feature extractors separately from ranking models based on traffic patterns.\n",
        "- **Team ownership**: Different teams can own and deploy their models independently.\n",
        "- **Flexible updates**: Update one component without redeploying the entire pipeline.\n",
        "- **Resource optimization**: Allocate different resources (CPU/GPU) to each component.\n",
        "\n",
        "See [Model Composition](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/model-composition.html) for the core concepts and patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use model composition when you have:\n",
        "- Multi-stage ML pipelines with distinct models.\n",
        "- Components that scale differently (for example lightweight feature extraction vs. heavy ranking).\n",
        "- Multiple teams contributing models to the same system.\n",
        "- Need to A/B test individual components.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Write a composed recommendation pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "Build a recommendation system with three components:\n",
        "1. **UserFeatureExtractor**: Extracts user features (demographics, history, preferences).\n",
        "2. **ItemRankingModel**: Scores items based on user features.\n",
        "3. **RecommendationService**: Orchestrates the pipeline and returns top recommendations.\n"
