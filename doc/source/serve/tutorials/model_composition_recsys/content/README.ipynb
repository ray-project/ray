    "This tutorial shows you how to build a recommendation system using Ray Serve's model composition pattern. Model composition breaks complex ML pipelines into independent deployments that you can scale and update separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why model composition for recommendation systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems typically involve multiple stages: feature extraction, candidate generation, ranking, and filtering. Model composition solves common challenges by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independent scaling**: Scale feature extractors separately from ranking models based on traffic patterns.\n",
    "- **Flexible updates**: Update one component without redeploying the entire pipeline.\n",
    "- **Resource optimization**: Allocate different resources (CPU/GPU) to each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Model Composition](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/model-composition.html) for the core concepts and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure a composed deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a recommendation system with three components:\n",
    "1. **UserFeatureExtractor**: Extracts user features (demographics, history, preferences).\n",
    "2. **ItemRankingModel**: Scores items based on user features.\n",
    "3. **RecommendationService**: Orchestrates the pipeline and returns top recommendations."
