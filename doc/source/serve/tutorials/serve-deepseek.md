# Serve DeepSeek

This example shows how to deploy DeepSeek R1 or V3 with Ray Serve LLM.

## Installation

To run this example, install the following:

```bash
pip install "ray[serve]"
```

## Code Structure

Save the following code to a file named `deepseek.py`:

```{literalinclude} ../doc_code/tutorial_deepseek.py
:language: python
:start-after: __deepseek_setup_start__
:end-before: __deepseek_setup_end__
```

## Configuration

You may need to adjust configurations in the above code based on your setup, specifically:

* `accelerator_type`: for NVIDIA GPUs, DeepSeek requires Hopper GPUs or later ones. Therefore, you can specify `H200`, `H100`, `H20` etc. based on your hardware.
* `tensor_parallel_size` and `pipeline_parallel_size`: DeepSeek requires a single node of 8xH200, or two nodes of 8xH100. The typical setup of using H100 is setting `tensor_parallel_size` to `8` and `pipeline_parallel_size` to `2` as in the code example. When using H200, you can set `tensor_parallel_size` to `8` and leave out the `pipeline_parallel_size` parameter (it is `1` by default).
* `model_source`: although you could specify a HuggingFace model ID like `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` in the code example, it is recommended to pre-download the model because it is huge. You can download it to the local file system (e.g., `/path/to/downloaded/model`) or to a remote object store (e.g., `s3://my-bucket/path/to/downloaded/model`), and specify it as `model_source`. It is recommended to download it to a remote object store, using :ref:`Ray model caching utilities <_model_cache>`. Note that if you have two nodes and would like to download to local file system, you need to download the model to the same path on both nodes.

## Deployment

Deploy the service with `python3 deepseek.py`.

## Testing the Service

You can query the deployed model using the following request and get the corresponding response.
