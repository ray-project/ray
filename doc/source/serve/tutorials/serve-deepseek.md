# Serve DeepSeek

This example shows how to deploy DeepSeek R1 or V3 with Ray Serve LLM.

## Installation

To run this example, install the following:

```bash
pip install "ray[llm]"
```

## Deployment

### Quick Deployment

For quick deployment and testing, save the following code to a file named `deepseek.py`,
and run `python3 deepseek.py`.

```python
from ray import serve
from ray.serve.llm import LLMConfig, build_openai_app

llm_config = LLMConfig(
    model_loading_config={
        "model_id": "deepseek",
        "model_source": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    },
    deployment_config={
        "autoscaling_config": {
            "min_replicas": 1,
            "max_replicas": 1,
        }
    },
    # Change to the accelerator type of the node
    accelerator_type="H100",
    runtime_env={"env_vars": {"VLLM_USE_V1": "1"}},
    # Customize engine arguments as needed (e.g. vLLM engine kwargs)
    engine_kwargs={
        "tensor_parallel_size": 8,
        "pipeline_parallel_size": 2,
        "gpu_memory_utilization": 0.92,
        "dtype": "auto",
        "max_num_seqs": 40,
        "max_model_len": 16384,
        "enable_chunked_prefill": True,
        "enable_prefix_caching": True,
        "trust_remote_code": True,
    },
)

# Deploy the application
llm_app = build_openai_app({"llm_configs": [llm_config]})
serve.run(llm_app)
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, save the following to a YAML file named `deepseek.yaml`
and run `serve run deepseek.yaml`.

```yaml
applications:
- args:
    llm_configs:
      - model_loading_config:
          model_id: "deepseek"
          model_source: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1"
        accelerator_type: "H100"
        deployment_config:
          autoscaling_config:
            min_replicas: 1
            max_replicas: 1
        runtime_env:
          env_vars:
            VLLM_USE_V1: "1"
        engine_kwargs:
          tensor_parallel_size: 8
          pipeline_parallel_size: 2
          gpu_memory_utilization: 0.92
          dtype: "auto"
          max_num_seqs: 40
          max_model_len: 16384
          enable_chunked_prefill: true
          enable_prefix_caching: true
          trust_remote_code: true
  import_path: ray.serve.llm:build_openai_app
  name: llm_app
  route_prefix: "/"
```

## Configuration

You may need to adjust configurations in the above code based on your setup, specifically:

* `accelerator_type`: for NVIDIA GPUs, DeepSeek requires Hopper GPUs or later ones. 
Therefore, you can specify `H200`, `H100`, `H20` etc. based on your hardware.
* `tensor_parallel_size` and `pipeline_parallel_size`: DeepSeek requires a single node of 8xH200,
or two nodes of 8xH100. The typical setup of using H100 is setting `tensor_parallel_size` to `8`
and `pipeline_parallel_size` to `2` as in the code example. When using H200, you can set
`tensor_parallel_size` to `8` and leave out the `pipeline_parallel_size` parameter
(it is `1` by default).
* `model_source`: although you could specify a HuggingFace model ID like `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` 
in the code example, it is recommended to pre-download the model because it is huge.
You can download it to the local file system (e.g., `/path/to/downloaded/model`)
or to a remote object store (e.g., `s3://my-bucket/path/to/downloaded/model`),
and specify it as `model_source`. It is recommended to download it to a remote object store,
using {ref}`Ray model caching utilities <model_cache>`. 
Note that if you have two nodes and would like to download to local file system,
you need to download the model to the same path on both nodes.


## Testing the Service

You can query the deployed model using the following request and get the corresponding response.
