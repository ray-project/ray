# Deploy Multiple Applications

Serve supports deploying multiple independent Serve applications. This user guide walks through how to generate a multi-application config file and deploy it using the Serve CLI, and monitor your applications using the CLI and the Ray Serve dashboard.

## Context
### Background 
With the introduction of multi-application Serve, we walk you through the new concept of applications and when you should choose to deploy a single application versus multiple applications per cluster. 

An application consists of one or more deployments. The deployments in an application are tied into a direct acyclic graph through [model composition](serve-model-composition). An application can be called via HTTP at the specified route prefix, and the ingress deployment handles all such inbound traffic. Due to the dependence between deployments in an application, one application is a unit of upgrade. 

### When to use multiple applications
You can solve many use cases by using either model composition or multi-application. However, both have their own individual benefits and can be used together.

Suppose you have multiple models and/or business logic that all need to be executed for a single request. If they are living in one repository, then you most likely upgrade them as a unit, so we recommend having all those deployments in one application.

On the other hand, if these models or business logic have logical groups, for example, groups of models that communicate with each other but live in different repositories, we recommend separating the models into applications. Another common use-case for multiple applications is separate groups of models that may not communicate with each other, but you want to co-host them to increase hardware utilization. Because one application is a unit of upgrade, having multiple applications allows you to deploy many independent models (or groups of models) each behind different endpoints. You can then easily add or delete applications from the cluster as well as upgrade applications independently of each other.

## Getting started

Define a Serve application:
```{literalinclude} doc_code/image_classifier_example.py
:language: python
:start-after: __serve_example_begin__
:end-before: __serve_example_end__
```

Copy this code to a file named `image_classifier.py`.

Define a second Serve application:
```{literalinclude} doc_code/translator_example.py
:language: python
:start-after: __serve_example_begin__
:end-before: __serve_example_end__
```
Copy this code to a file named `text_translator.py`.

Generate a multi-application config file that contains both of these two applications and save it to `config.yaml`.

```
serve build --multi-app image_classifier:app text_translator:app -o config.yaml
```

This generates the following config:
```yaml
proxy_location: EveryNode

http_options:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8000

grpc_options:
  port: 9000
  grpc_servicer_functions: []

applications:
- name: app1
  route_prefix: /classify
  import_path: image_classifier:app
  runtime_env: {}
  deployments:
  - name: downloader
  - name: ImageClassifier

- name: app2
  route_prefix: /translate
  import_path: text_translator:app
  runtime_env: {}
  deployments:
  - name: Translator
```

:::{note} 
The names for each application are auto-generated as `app1`, `app2`, etc. To give custom names to the applications, modify the config file before moving on to the next step.
:::

### Deploy the applications
To deploy the applications, be sure to start a Ray cluster first.

```console
$ ray start --head

$ serve deploy config.yaml
> Sent deploy request successfully!
```

Query the applications at their respective endpoints, `/classify` and `/translate`.
```{literalinclude} doc_code/image_classifier_example.py
:language: python
:start-after: __request_begin__
:end-before: __request_end__
```
```{literalinclude} doc_code/translator_example.py
:language: python
:start-after: __request_begin__
:end-before: __request_end__
```

#### Development workflow with `serve run`
You can also use the CLI command `serve run` to run and test your application easily, either locally or on a remote cluster. 
```console
$ serve run config.yaml
> 2023-04-04 11:00:05,901 INFO scripts.py:327 -- Deploying from config file: "config.yaml".
> 2023-04-04 11:00:07,505 INFO worker.py:1613 -- Started a local Ray instance. View the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265
> 2023-04-04 11:00:09,012 SUCC scripts.py:393 -- Submitted deploy config successfully.
```

The `serve run` command blocks the terminal, which allows logs from Serve to stream to the console. This helps you test and debug your applications easily. If you want to change your code, you can hit Ctrl-C to interrupt the command and shutdown Serve and all its applications, then rerun `serve run`.

:::{note}
`serve run` only supports running multi-application config files. If you want to run applications by directly passing in an import path, `serve run` can only run one application import path at a time.
:::

### Check status
Check the status of the applications by running `serve status`.

```console
$ serve status
proxies:
  2e02a03ad64b3f3810b0dd6c3265c8a00ac36c13b2b0937cbf1ef153: HEALTHY
applications:
  app1:
    status: RUNNING
    message: ''
    last_deployed_time_s: 1693267064.0735464
    deployments:
      downloader:
        status: HEALTHY
        replica_states:
          RUNNING: 1
        message: ''
      ImageClassifier:
        status: HEALTHY
        replica_states:
          RUNNING: 1
        message: ''
  app2:
    status: RUNNING
    message: ''
    last_deployed_time_s: 1693267064.0735464
    deployments:
      Translator:
        status: HEALTHY
        replica_states:
          RUNNING: 1
        message: ''
```

### Send requests between applications
You can also make calls between applications without going through HTTP by using the Serve API `serve.get_app_handle` to get a handle to any live Serve application on the cluster. This handle can be used to directly execute a request on an application. Take the classifier and translator app above as an example. You can modify the `__call__` method of the `ImageClassifier` to check for another parameter in the HTTP request, and send requests to the translator application.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/image_classifier_example.py
:language: python
:start-after: __serve_example_modified_begin__
:end-before: __serve_example_modified_end__
```

Then, send requests to the classifier application with the `should_translate` flag set to True:
```{literalinclude} doc_code/image_classifier_example.py
:language: python
:start-after: __second_request_begin__
:end-before: __second_request_end__
```


### Inspect deeper

For more visibility into the applications running on the cluster, go to the Ray Serve dashboard at [`http://localhost:8265/#/serve`](http://localhost:8265/#/serve).

You can see all applications that are deployed on the Ray cluster:

![applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/images/master/docs/serve/multi-app/applications-dashboard.png)

The list of deployments under each application:

![deployments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/images/master/docs/serve/multi-app/deployments-dashboard.png)

As well as the list of replicas for each deployment:

![replicas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/images/master/docs/serve/multi-app/replica-dashboard.png)

For more details on the Ray Serve dashboard, see the [Serve dashboard documentation](dash-serve-view).


## Add, delete, and update applications
You can add, remove or update entries under the `applications` field to add, remove or update applications in the cluster. This doesn't affect other applications on the cluster. To update an application, modify the config options in the corresponding entry under the `applications` field.

:::{note}
The in-place update behavior for an application when you resubmit a config is the same as the single-application behavior. For how an application reacts to different config changes, see [Updating a Serve Application](serve-inplace-updates).

### Migrating from a single-application config

Migrating the single-application config `ServeApplicationSchema` to the multi-application config format `ServeDeploySchema` is straightforward. Each entry under the  `applications` field matches the old, single-application config format. To convert a single-application config to the multi-application config format:
* Copy the entire old config to an entry under the `applications` field.
* Remove `host` and `port` from the entry and move them under the `http_options` field.
* Name the application.
* If you haven't already, set the application-level `route_prefix` to the route prefix of the ingress deployment in the application. In a multi-application config, you should set route prefixes at the application level instead of for the ingress deployment in each application.
* When needed, add more applications.

For more details on the multi-application config format, see the documentation for [`ServeDeploySchema`](serve-rest-api-config-schema).

:::{note} 
You must remove `host` and `port` from the application entry. In a multi-application config, specifying cluster-level options within an individual application isn't applicable, and is not supported.
