# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through the process of deploying models with Ray Serve. It will show you how to

* expose your models over HTTP using deployments
* test your deployments over HTTP
* compose multiple-model machine learning models together into a single application

We'll use two models in this tutorial:

* [HuggingFace's TranslationPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.TranslationPipeline) as a text-translation model
* [HuggingFace's SummarizationPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.21.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.SummarizationPipeline) as a text-summarizer model

You can also follow along using your own models from any Python framework.

After deploying those two models, we'll test them with HTTP requests.

To run this example, you will need to install the following:

```bash
pip install "ray[serve]" transformers requests
```


## Model Example: Before Ray Serve

First, let's take a look at our text-translation model. Here's its code:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/models.py
:start-after: __start_translation_model__
:end-before: __end_translation_model__
:language: python
:linenos: true
```

The Python file, called `model.py`, uses the `Translator` class to translate English text to French.

- The `self.model` variable on line 8 inside `Translator`'s `__init__` method
  stores a function that uses the [t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small)
  model to translate text.
- When `self.model` is called on English text, it returns translated French text
  inside a dictionary formatted as `[{"translation_text": "..."}]`.
- The `Translator`'s `translate` method extracts the translated text on
  line 15 by indexing into the dictionary.

You can copy-paste this script and run it locally. It translates `"Hello world!"`
into `"Bonjour Monde!"`.

```console
$ python model.py

Bonjour Monde!
```

Keep in mind that the `TranslationPipeline` is an example ML model for this
tutorial. You can follow along using arbitrary models from any
Python framework. Check out our tutorials on scikit-learn,
PyTorch, and Tensorflow for more info and examples:

## Converting to a Ray Serve Deployment

In this section, we'll deploy the text translation model using Ray Serve, so
it can be scaled up and queried over HTTP. We'll start by converting
`Translator` into a Ray Serve deployment that runs locally on your computer.

First, we open a new Python file and import `ray` and `ray serve`:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_deployment.py
:start-after: __import_start__
:end-before: __import_end__
:language: python
```

After these imports, we can include our model code from above:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_deployment.py
:start-after: __model_start__
:end-before: __model_end__
:language: python
```

The `Translator` class has two modifications:
1. It has a decorator, `@serve.deployment`.
2. It has a new method, `__call__`.

The decorator converts `Translator` from a Python class into a Ray Serve
`Deployment` object.

Each deployment stores a single Python function or class that you write and uses
it to serve requests. You can scale and configure each of your deployments independently using
parameters in the `@serve.deployment` decorator. The example configures a few common parameters:

* `num_replicas`: an integer that determines how many copies of our deployment process run in Ray. Requests are load balanced across these replicas, allowing you to scale your deployments horizontally.
* `ray_actor_options`: a dictionary containing configuration options for each replica.
    * `num_cpus`: a float representing the logical number of CPUs each replica should reserve. You can make this a fraction to pack multiple replicas together on a machine with fewer CPUs than replicas.
    * `num_gpus`: a float representing the logical number of GPUs each replica should reserve. You can make this a fraction to pack multiple replicas together on a machine with fewer GPUs than replicas.

All these parameters are optional, so feel free to omit them:

```python
...
@serve.deployment
class Translator:
  ...
```

Deployments receive Starlette HTTP `request` objects [^f1]. If your deployment stores a Python function, the function is called on this `request` object. If your deployment stores a class, the class's `__call__` method is called on this `request` object. The return value is sent back in the HTTP response body.

This is why `Translator` needs a new `__call__` method. The method processes the incoming HTTP request by reading its JSON data and forwarding it to the `translate` method. The translated text is returned and sent back through the HTTP response. You can also use Ray Serve's FastAPI integration to avoid working with raw HTTP requests. Check out {ref}`serve-fastapi-http` for more info about FastAPI with Serve.

Next, we need to `bind` our `Translator` deployment to arguments that Ray Serve can pass into its constructor. This will let Ray Serve initialize a `Translator` object that can serve requests. Since `Translator`'s constructor doesn't take in any arguments, we can call the deployment's `bind` method without passing anything in:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_deployment.py
:start-after: __model_deploy_start__
:end-before: __model_deploy_end__
:language: python
```

With that, we can run our model on Ray Serve!
Here's the full Ray Serve script that we built:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_deployment_full.py
:start-after: __deployment_full_start__
:end-before: __deployment_full_end__
:language: python
:linenos: true
```

We can run our script with the `serve run` CLI command. This command takes in an import path
to our deployment formatted as `module:bound_deployment`. Make sure to run the command from a directory containing a local copy of this script, so it can find the bound deployment:

```console
$ serve run serve_deployment:translator
```

This command will start running `Translator` and then block. It can be killed with `ctrl-C` in the terminal.

## Testing Ray Serve Deployments

We can now test our model over HTTP. It can be reached at the following URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Since the cluster is deployed locally in this tutorial, the `127.0.0.1:8000`
refers to a localhost with port 8000 (the default port where you can reach
Serve deployments).

We'll send a POST request with JSON data containing our English text.
`Translator`'s `__call__` method will unpack this text and forward it to the
`translate` method. Here's a client script that requests a translation for "Hello world!":

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_deployment.py
:start-after: __client_function_start__
:end-before: __client_function_end__
:language: python
```

To test our deployment, first make sure `Translator` is running:

```
$ serve run serve_deployment:translator
```

While `Translator` is running, we can open a separate terminal window and run the client script. This will get a response over HTTP:

```console
$ python model_client.py

Bonjour monde!
```

## Composing Machine Learning Models with Deployment Graphs

Ray Serve's Deployment Graph API allows us to compose multiple machine learning models together into a single Ray Serve application. We can use parameters like `num_replicas`, `num_cpus`, and `num_gpus` to independently configure and scale each deployment in the graph.

For example, let's deploy a machine learning pipeline with two steps:

1. Summarize English text
2. Translate the summary into French

`Translator` already performs step 2. We can use [HuggingFace's SummarizationPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.21.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.SummarizationPipeline) to accomplish step 1. Here's an example of the `SummarizationPipeline` that runs locally:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/models.py
:start-after: __start_summarization_model__
:end-before: __end_summarization_model__
:language: python
```

You can copy-paste this script and run it locally. It summarizes the snippet from _A Tale of Two Cities_ to `it was the best of times, it was worst of times .`

```console
$ python model.py

it was the best of times, it was worst of times .
```

Here's a Ray Serve deployment graph that chains the two models together. The graph takes English text, summarizes it, and then translates it:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_graph.py
:start-after: __start_graph__
:end-before: __end_graph__
:language: python
:linenos: true
```

This script contains our `Summarizer` class converted to a deployment and our `Translator` class with some modifications. In this script, the `Summarizer` class contains the `__call__` method since requests are sent to it first. It also takes in the `Translator` as one of its constructor arguments, so it can forward summarized texts to the `Translator` deployment. The `__call__` method also contains some new code on lines 44 and 45:

```python
translation_ref = self.translator.translate.remote(summary)
translation = ray.get(translation_ref)
```

`self.translator.translate.remote(summary)` issues an asynchronous call to the `Translator`'s `translate` method. Essentially, this line tells Ray to schedule a request to the `Translator` deployment's `translate` method, which can be fulfilled asynchronously. The line immediately returns a reference to the method's output. The next line `ray.get(translation_ref)` waits for `translate` to execute and returns the value of that execution.

We compose our graph in line 50:

```python
deployment_graph = Summarizer.bind(Translator.bind())
```

Here, we bind `Translator` to its (empty) constructor arguments, and then we pass in the bound `Translator` as the constructor argument for the `Summarizer`. We can run this deployment graph using the `serve run` CLI command. Make sure to run this command from a directory containing a local copy of the `graph.py` code:

```console
$ serve run graph:deployment_graph
```

We can use this client script to make requests to the graph:

```{literalinclude} ../serve/doc_code/getting_started/model_graph.py
:start-after: __start_client__
:end-before: __end_client__
:language: python
```

While the graph is running, we can open a separate terminal window and run the client script:

```console
$ python graph_client.py

c'était le meilleur des temps, c'était le pire des temps .
```

Deployment graphs are useful since they let you deploy each part of your machine learning pipeline, such as inference and business logic steps, in separate deployments. Each of these deployments can be individually configured and scaled, ensuring you get maximal performance from your resources.
