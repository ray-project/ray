# Serve Config Files (`serve build`)

This section should help you:

- understand the Serve config file format.
- understand how to generate and update a config file for a Serve application.

This config file can be used with the [serve deploy](serve-in-production-deploying) command CLI or embedded in a [RayService](serve-in-production-kubernetes) custom resource in Kubernetes to deploy and update your application in production.
The file is written in YAML and has the following format:

```yaml
proxy_location: ...

http_options: 
  host: ...
  port: ...
  request_timeout_s: ...

applications:
- name: ...
  route_prefix: ...
  import_path: ...
  runtime_env: ... 
  deployments:
  - name: ...
    num_replicas: ...
    ...
  - name:
    ...
```

The file contains `http_options` and `applications`. These are the `http_options`:

- `host` and `port` are HTTP options that determine the host IP address and the port for your Serve application's HTTP proxies. These are optional settings and can be omitted. By default, the `host` will be set to `0.0.0.0` to expose your deployments publicly, and the port will be set to `8000`. If you're using Kubernetes, setting `host` to `0.0.0.0` is necessary to expose your deployments outside the cluster.
- `request_timeout_s` is a field in the `http_options` that allows you to set the end-to-end timeout for a request before terminating and retrying at another replica. This config is global to your Ray cluster, and it cannot be updated during runtime. By default, the Serve HTTP proxy retries up to `10` times when a response is not received due to failures (e.g. network disconnect, request timeout, etc.). By default, there is no request timeout. 

These are the fields per application:

- `name` - The names for each application are auto-generated by `serve build`. The name per application must be unique. 
- `route_prefix` - An application can be called via HTTP at the specified route prefix. It defaults to `/`. The route prefix for each application must be unique 
- An `import_path`, which is the path to your top-level Serve deployment (or the same path passed to `serve run`). The most minimal config file consists of only an `import_path`.
- A `runtime_env` that defines the environment that the application will run in. This is used to package application dependencies such as `pip` packages (see {ref}`Runtime Environments <runtime-environments>` for supported fields). The `import_path` must be available _within_ the `runtime_env` if it's specified. The Serve config's `runtime_env` can only use [remote URIs](remote-uris) in its `working_dir` and `py_modules`; it cannot use local zip files or directories. [More details on runtime env](serve-runtime-env).
- A list of `deployments`. This is optional and allows you to override the `@serve.deployment` settings specified in the deployment graph code. Each entry in this list must include the deployment `name`, which must match one in the code. If this section is omitted, Serve launches all deployments in the graph with the settings specified in the code.

Below is an equivalent config for the [`Text ML Model` example](serve-in-production-example):

```yaml
proxy_location: EveryNode

http_options:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8000

applications:
- name: default
  route_prefix: /
  import_path: text_ml:app
  runtime_env: {}
  deployments:
  - name: Translator
    num_replicas: 1
  - name: Summarizer
    num_replicas: 1
```

The file uses the same `text_ml:app` import path that was used with `serve run` and it has two entries in the `deployments` list for the translation and summarization deployments. All the entries contain a `name` setting and some other configuration options such as `num_replicas`.

:::{tip}
Each individual entry in the `deployments` list is optional. In the example config file above, we could omit the `Summarizer`, including its `name` and `num_replicas`, and the file would still be valid. When we deploy the file, the `Summarizer` deployment will still be deployed, using the configurations set in the `@serve.deployment` decorator from the application's code.
:::

We can also auto-generate this config file from the code. The `serve build` command takes an import path to your deployment graph and it creates a config file containing all the deployments and their settings from the graph. You can tweak these settings to manage your deployments in production.

```console
$ ls
text_ml.py

$ serve build text_ml:app -o serve_config.yaml

$ ls
text_ml.py
serve_config.yaml
```

(production-config-yaml)=
The `serve_config.yaml` file contains:

```yaml
proxy_location: EveryNode

http_options:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8000

grpc_options:
  port: 9000
  grpc_servicer_functions: []

applications:
- name: default
  route_prefix: /
  import_path: text_ml:app
  runtime_env: {}
  deployments:
  - name: Translator
    user_config:
      language: french
  - name: Summarizer
```

Note that the `runtime_env` field will always be empty when using `serve build` and must be set manually.

Additionally, `serve build` includes the default HTTP and gPRC options in its
autogenerated files. You can modify these parameters.
