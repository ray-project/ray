# Set Up gRPC Proxy

This section helps you understand how to:
- build a user defined gRPC service and protobuf
- start Serve with gRPC proxy
- deploy gRPC applications
- send gRPC requests to Serve deployments
- Serve provided service methods
- metadata and error handling
- more examples

## Define a gRPC Service
To run a gRPC server it starts with first defining gRPC services, rpc methods, and 
protobufs similar to the one below.

```proto
// user_defined_protos.proto

syntax = "proto3";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "io.ray.examples.user_defined_protos";
option java_outer_classname = "UserDefinedProtos";

package userdefinedprotos;

message UserDefinedMessage {
  string name = 1;
  string foo = 2;
  int64 num = 3;
}

message UserDefinedResponse {
  string greeting = 1;
  int64 num_x2 = 2;
}

message UserDefinedMessage2 {}

message UserDefinedResponse2 {
  string greeting = 1;
}

message FruitAmounts {
    int64 orange = 1;
    int64 apple = 2;
    int64 banana = 3;
}

message FruitCosts {
    float costs = 1;
}

service UserDefinedService {
  rpc __call__(UserDefinedMessage) returns (UserDefinedResponse);
  rpc Method1(UserDefinedMessage) returns (UserDefinedResponse);
  rpc Method2(UserDefinedMessage2) returns (UserDefinedResponse2);
  rpc Streaming(UserDefinedMessage) returns (stream UserDefinedResponse);
}

service FruitService {
  rpc FruitStand(FruitAmounts) returns (FruitCosts);
}
```

In this example, we created a file named `user_defined_protos.proto`. There are two
gRPC services, `UserDefinedService` and `FruitService`. `UserDefinedService` has four
rpc methods, `__call__`, `Method1`, `Method2`, and `Streaming`. `FruitService` has one 
rpc method, `FruitStand`. Their corresponding input and output types are also defined
specifically for each rpc method.

Once the `.proto` services are defined, we can use `grpcio-tools` to compile python 
code for those services. With the following command
```bash
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ./user_defined_protos.proto
```

It will generate two files, `user_defined_protos_pb2.py` and 
`user_defined_protos_pb2_grpc.py`.
```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/user_defined_protos_pb2.py
:start-after: __begin__
:end-before: __end__
:language: python
```

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/user_defined_protos_pb2_grpc.py
:start-after: __begin__
:end-before: __end__
:language: python
```

:::{note}
Depending on the version of `grpcio-tools` you are using, the generated code may be
slightly different. But all the class and functions should be importable.
:::

For more details on `grpcio-tools` see: https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/basics/#generating-client-and-server-code

(start-serve-with-grpc-proxy)=
## Start Serve with gRPC Proxy
[Serve start](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-2.7.0/serve/api/index.html#serve-start) CLI 
and [`ray.serve.start`](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-2.7.0/serve/api/doc/ray.serve.start.html#ray.serve.start) API 
both support starting Serve with gRPC proxy. There are two options related to Serve's 
gRPC proxy, `grpc_port` and `grpc_servicer_functions`. `grpc_port` is the port for gRPC 
proxies to listen on. It defaults to 9000. `grpc_servicer_functions` is a list of import 
paths for gRPC `add_servicer_to_server` functions to add to Serveâ€™s gRPC proxy. It also 
serves as the flag to determine whether to start gRPC server. Default empty list, 
meaning no gRPC server will be started. 

To start gRPC proxy with the CLI
```bash
ray start --head
serve start \
  --grpc-port 9000 \
  --grpc-servicer-functions user_defined_protos_pb2_grpc.add_UserDefinedServiceServicer_to_server \
  --grpc-servicer-functions user_defined_protos_pb2_grpc.add_FruitServiceServicer_to_server

```

To start gRPC proxy with Python api
```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/grpc_guide.py
:start-after: __begin_start_grpc_proxy__
:end-before: __end_start_grpc_proxy__
:language: python
```










(serve-grpc)=
## Calling Deployments via gRPC
When you deploy a Serve application, the [ingress deployment](serve-key-concepts-ingress-deployment) (the one passed to `serve.run`) is exposed over HTTP.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/http_guide.py
:start-after: __begin_starlette__
:end-before: __end_starlette__
:language: python
```

Requests to the Serve HTTP server at `/` are routed to the deployment's `__call__` method with a [Starlette Request object](https://www.starlette.io/requests/) as the sole argument. The `__call__` method can return any JSON-serializable object or a [Starlette Response object](https://www.starlette.io/responses/) (e.g., to return a custom status code or custom headers).

Often for ML models, you just need the API to accept a `numpy` array. You can use Serve's `DAGDriver` to simplify the request parsing.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/http_guide.py
:start-after: __begin_dagdriver__
:end-before: __end_dagdriver__
:language: python
```

```{note}
Serve provides a library of HTTP adapters to help you avoid boilerplate code. The [later section](serve-http-adapters) dives deeper into how these works.
```

(serve-fastapi-http)=
## FastAPI HTTP Deployments

If you want to define more complex HTTP handling logic, Serve integrates with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). This allows you to define a Serve deployment using the {mod}`@serve.ingress <ray.serve.api.ingress>` decorator that wraps a FastAPI app with its full range of features. The most basic example of this is shown below, but for more details on all that FastAPI has to offer such as variable routes, automatic type validation, dependency injection (e.g., for database connections), and more, please check out [their documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/http_guide.py
:start-after: __begin_fastapi__
:end-before: __end_fastapi__
:language: python
```

Now if you send a request to `/hello`, this will be routed to the `root` method of our deployment. We can also easily leverage FastAPI to define multiple routes with different HTTP methods:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/http_guide.py
:start-after: __begin_fastapi_multi_routes__
:end-before: __end_fastapi_multi_routes__
:language: python
```

You can also pass in an existing FastAPI app to a deployment to serve it as-is:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/http_guide.py
:start-after: __begin_byo_fastapi__
:end-before: __end_byo_fastapi__
:language: python
```

This is useful for scaling out an existing FastAPI app with no modifications necessary.
Existing middlewares, **automatic OpenAPI documentation generation**, and other advanced FastAPI features should work as-is.

### WebSockets

Serve supports WebSockets via FastAPI:

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/websockets_example.py
:start-after: __websocket_serve_app_start__
:end-before: __websocket_serve_app_end__
:language: python
```

Decorate the function that handles WebSocket requests with `@app.websocket`. Read more about FastAPI WebSockets in the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/).

Query the deployment using the `websockets` package (`pip install websockets`):

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/websockets_example.py
:start-after: __websocket_serve_client_start__
:end-before: __websocket_serve_client_end__
:language: python
```

(serve-http-streaming-response)=
## Streaming Responses

Some applications must stream incremental results back to the caller.
This is common for text generation using large language models (LLMs) or video processing applications.
The full forward pass may take multiple seconds, so providing incremental results as they're available provides a much better user experience.

To use HTTP response streaming, return a [StreamingResponse](https://www.starlette.io/responses/#streamingresponse) that wraps a generator from your HTTP handler.
This is supported for basic HTTP ingress deployments using a `__call__` method and when using the [FastAPI integration](serve-fastapi-http).

The code below defines a Serve application that incrementally streams numbers up to a provided `max`.
The client-side code is also updated to handle the streaming outputs.
This code uses the `stream=True` option to the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#streaming-requests) library.

```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/streaming_example.py
:start-after: __begin_example__
:end-before: __end_example__
:language: python
```

Save this code in `stream.py` and run it:

```bash
$ python stream.py

```

### Handling client disconnects

In some cases, you may want to cease processing a request when the client disconnects before the full stream has been returned.
If you pass an async generator to `StreamingResponse`, it will be cancelled and raise an `asyncio.CancelledError` when the client disconnects.
Note that you must `await` at some point in the generator for the cancellation to occur.

In the example below, the generator streams responses forever until the client disconnects, then it prints that it was cancelled and exits. Save this code in `stream.py` and run it:


```{literalinclude} doc_code/http_guide/streaming_example.py
:start-after: __begin_cancellation__
:end-before: __end_cancellation__
:language: python
```

```bash

(serve-http-adapters)=

## HTTP Adapters
HTTP adapters are functions that convert raw HTTP requests to basic Python types that you know and recognize.

For example, here is an adapter that extracts the JSON content from a request:

```python
async def json_resolver(request: starlette.requests.Request):
    return await request.json()
```

The input arguments to an HTTP adapter should be type-annotated. At a minimum, the adapter should accept a `starlette.requests.Request` type (https://www.starlette.io/requests/#request),
but it can also accept any type that's recognized by [FastAPI's dependency injection framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/).

Here is an HTTP adapter that accepts two HTTP query parameters:

```python
def parse_query_args(field_a: int, field_b: str):
    return YourDataClass(field_a, field_b)
```

You can specify different type signatures to facilitate the extraction of HTTP fields, including
- [query parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/),
- [body parameters](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/),
- [many other data types](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-data-types/).

For more details, you can take a look at the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

In addition to above adapters, you also use other adapters. Below we examine at least two:

- Serve Deployment Graph `DAGDriver`
- Embedded in Bring Your Own `FastAPI` Application

### Serve Deployment Graph `DAGDriver`

When using a [Serve deployment graph](serve-deployment-graphs), you can configure
`ray.serve.drivers.DAGDriver` to accept an HTTP adapter via its `http_adapter` field.

For example, the `json_request` adapter parses JSON in the HTTP body:

```python
from ray.serve.drivers import DAGDriver
from ray.serve.http_adapters import json_request
from ray.dag.input_node import InputNode

with InputNode() as input_node:
    # ...
    dag = DAGDriver.bind(other_node, http_adapter=json_request)
```

### Embedded in your existing `FastAPI` Application

You can also bring the adapter to your own FastAPI app using
[Depends](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/#import-depends).
The input schema automatically become part of the generated OpenAPI schema with FastAPI.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from ray.serve.http_adapters import json_to_ndarray

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/endpoint")
async def endpoint(np_array = Depends(json_to_ndarray)):
    ...
```


### Pydantic models as adapters

Serve also supports [pydantic models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) as a shorthand for HTTP adapters in model wrappers. Instead of using a function to define your HTTP adapter as in the examples above,
you can directly pass in a pydantic model class to effectively tell Ray Serve to validate the HTTP body with this schema.
Once validated, the model instance will passed to the predictor.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    user_name: str

# ...

DAGDriver.bind(other_node, http_adapter=User)

```
### List of built-in adapters
