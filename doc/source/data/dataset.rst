Ray Datasets: Distributed Data Preprocessing
============================================

.. _datasets-intro:

Ray Datasets are the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray libraries and applications.
They provide basic distributed data transformations such as maps
(:meth:`map_batches <ray.data.Dataset.map_batches>`),
global and grouped aggregations (:class:`GroupedDataset <ray.data.grouped_dataset.GroupedDataset>`), and
shuffling operations (:meth:`random_shuffle <ray.data.Dataset.random_shuffle>`,
:meth:`sort <ray.data.Dataset.sort>`,
:meth:`repartition <ray.data.Dataset.repartition>`),
and are compatible with a variety of file formats, data sources, and distributed frameworks.

Here's an overview of the integrations with other processing frameworks, file formats, and supported operations,
as well as a glimpse at the Ray Datasets API.

Check the :ref:`Input/Output reference <input-output>` to see if your favorite format
is already supported.

----------------------------------------------
Data Loading and Preprocessing for ML Training
----------------------------------------------

Use Ray Datasets to load and preprocess data for distributed :ref:`ML training pipelines <train-docs>`.
Compared to other loading solutions, Datasets are more flexible (e.g., can express higher-quality per-epoch global shuffles) and provides `higher overall performance <https://www.anyscale.com/blog/why-third-generation-ml-platforms-are-more-performant>`__.

Use Datasets as a last-mile bridge from storage or ETL pipeline outputs to distributed 
applications and libraries in Ray. Don't use it as a replacement for more general data 
processing systems.

To learn more about the features Datasets supports, read the 
:ref:`Datasets User Guide <data_user_guide>`.

-----------------------------
Datasets for Parallel Compute
-----------------------------

Datasets also simplify general purpose parallel GPU and CPU compute in Ray; for
instance, for :ref:`GPU batch inference <ref-use-cases-batch-infer>`.
They provide a higher-level API for Ray tasks and actors for such embarrassingly parallel compute,
internally handling operations like batching, pipelining, and memory management.

As part of the Ray ecosystem, Ray Datasets can leverage the full functionality of Ray's distributed scheduler,
e.g., using actors for optimizing setup time and GPU scheduling.

As new user of Ray Datasets, you may want to start with our :ref:`Getting Started guide<datasets_getting_started>`.
If you've run your first examples already, you might want to dive into Ray Datasets'
:ref:`key concepts <data_key_concepts>` or our :ref:`User Guide <data_user_guide>` instead.
Advanced users can refer directly to the Ray Datasets :ref:`API reference <data-api>` for their projects.
