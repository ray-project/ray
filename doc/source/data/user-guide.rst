If youâ€™re new to Ray Data, we recommend starting with the :ref:`Ray Data Quick Start <ray_data_quick_start>`.
This user guide will help you navigate the Ray Data project and show you how achieve several tasks, for instance
you will learn

- how to load data and preprocess it for machine learning applications,
- how to use Tensors with Ray Data,
- how to run Dataset Pipelines in common scenarios,
- how to run Dask, Spark, Mars or Modin on Ray Data,
- and how to tune your Ray Data applications for performance.
