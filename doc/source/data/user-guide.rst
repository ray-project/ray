If youâ€™re new to Ray Datasets, we recommend starting with the :ref:`Ray Datasets Quick Start <ray_datasets_quick_start>`.
This user guide will help you navigate the Ray Datasets project and show you how achieve several tasks, for instance
you will learn

- how to load data and preprocess it for machine learning applications,
- how to use Tensors with Ray Datasets,
- how to run Dataset Pipelines in common scenarios,
- how to run Dask, Spark, Mars or Modin on Ray,
- and how to tune your Ray Datasets applications for performance.
