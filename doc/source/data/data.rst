======================================
Ray Data: Distributed ML Preprocessing
======================================

.. _data-intro:

Ray Data is the standard way to load and exchange data in Ray libraries and applications.
It provides streaming distributed transformations such as maps
(:meth:`map_batches <ray.data.Datastream.map_batches>`),
global and grouped aggregations (:class:`GroupedData <ray.data.grouped_data.GroupedData>`), and
shuffling operations (:meth:`random_shuffle <ray.data.Datastream.random_shuffle>`,
:meth:`sort <ray.data.Datastream.sort>`,
:meth:`repartition <ray.data.Datastream.repartition>`),
and is compatible with a variety of file formats, data sources, and distributed frameworks.

Read on for an overview of the main use cases and operations supported by Ray Data.

-------------------------
Streaming Batch Inference
-------------------------

Ray Data simplifies general purpose parallel GPU and CPU compute in Ray through its
powerful :ref:`Datastream <datastream_concept>` primitive. Datastreams enable workloads such as 
:ref:`GPU batch inference <ref-use-cases-batch-infer>` to run efficiently on large datasets,
maximizing resource utilization by keeping the working data fitting into Ray object store memory.

As part of the Ray ecosystem, Ray Data can leverage the full functionality of Ray's distributed scheduler,
e.g., using actors for optimizing setup time and GPU scheduling, and supports data throughputs of
100GiB/s or more for common inference workloads.

To learn more about the features Ray Data supports, read the 
:ref:`Data User Guide <data_user_guide>`.

---------------------------------------
Streaming Preprocessing for ML Training
---------------------------------------

Use Ray Data to load and preprocess data for distributed :ref:`ML training pipelines <train-docs>` in a streaming fashion.
Ray Data is intended to serve as a last-mile bridge from storage or ETL pipeline outputs to distributed 
applications and libraries in Ray. Don't use it as a replacement for more general data 
processing systems.

As new user of Ray Data, you may want to start with our :ref:`Getting Started Guide <data_getting_started>`.
If you've run your first examples already, you might want to dive into Ray Data'
:ref:`key concepts <data_key_concepts>` or our :ref:`User Guide <data_user_guide>` instead.
Advanced users can refer directly to the Ray Data :ref:`API reference <data-api>` for their projects.
