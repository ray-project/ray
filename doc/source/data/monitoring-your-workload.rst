Monitoring Your Workload
========================

This section helps you debug and monitor the execution of your :class:`~ray.data.Dataset` by viewing the:

* :ref:`Ray Data dashboard <ray-data-dashboard>`
* :ref:`Ray Data logs <ray-data-logs>`
* :ref:`Ray Data stats <ray-data-stats>`


.. _ray-data-dashboard:

Ray Data dashboard
------------------

Ray Data emits Prometheus metrics in real-time while a Dataset is executing. These metrics are tagged by both dataset and operator, and are displayed in multiple views across the Ray dashboard.

.. note::
   Most metrics are only available for physical operators that use the map operation. For example, physical operators created by :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.map_batches`, :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.map`, and :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.flat_map`.

Jobs: Ray Data overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an overview of all datasets that have been running on your cluster, see the Ray Data Overview in the :ref:`jobs view <dash-jobs-view>`. This table appears once the first dataset starts executing on the cluster, and shows dataset details such as:

* execution progress (measured in blocks)
* execution state (running, failed, or finished)
* dataset start/end time
* dataset-level metrics (for example, sum of rows processed over all operators)

.. image:: images/data-overview-table.png
   :align: center

For a more fine-grained overview, each dataset row in the table can also be expanded to display the same details for individual operators.

.. image:: images/data-overview-table-expanded.png
   :align: center

.. tip::

    To evaluate a dataset-level metric where it's not appropriate to sum the values of all the individual operators, it may be more useful to look at the operator-level metrics of the last operator. For example, to calculate a dataset's throughput, use the "Rows Outputted" of the dataset's last operator, because the dataset-level metric contains the sum of rows outputted over all operators.

Ray dashboard metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a time-series view of these metrics, see the Ray Data section in the :ref:`Metrics view <dash-metrics-view>`. This section contains time-series graphs of all metrics emitted by Ray Data. Execution metrics are grouped by dataset and operator, and iteration metrics are grouped by dataset.

The metrics recorded include:

* Bytes spilled by objects from object store to disk
* Bytes of objects allocated in object store
* Bytes of objects freed in object store
* Current total bytes of objects in object store
* Logical CPUs allocated to dataset operators
* Logical GPUs allocated to dataset operators
* Bytes outputted by dataset operators
* Rows outputted by dataset operators
* Input blocks received by data operators
* Input blocks/bytes processed in tasks by data operators
* Input bytes submitted to tasks by data operators
* Output blocks/bytes/rows generated in tasks by data operators
* Output blocks/bytes taken by downstream operators
* Output blocks/bytes from finished tasks
* Submitted tasks
* Running tasks
* Tasks with at least one output block
* Finished tasks
* Failed tasks
* Operator internal inqueue size (in blocks/bytes)
* Operator internal outqueue size (in blocks/bytes)
* Size of blocks used in pending tasks
* Freed memory in object store
* Spilled memory in object store
* Time spent generating blocks
* Time spent in task submission backpressure
* Time spent to initialize iteration.
* Time user code is blocked during iteration.
* Time spent in user code during iteration.

.. _ray-data-logs:

Ray Data logs
-------------
During execution, Ray Data periodically logs updates to `ray-data.log`.

Every five seconds, Ray Data logs the execution progress of every operator in the dataset. For more frequent updates, set `RAY_DATA_TRACE_SCHEDULING=1` so that the progress is logged after each task is dispatched.

.. code-block:: text

   Execution Progress:
   0: - Input: 0 active, 0 queued, 0.0 MiB objects, Blocks Outputted: 200/200
   1: - ReadRange->MapBatches(<lambda>): 10 active, 190 queued, 381.47 MiB objects, Blocks Outputted: 100/200

When an operator completes, the metrics for that operator are also logged.

.. code-block:: text

   Operator InputDataBuffer[Input] -> TaskPoolMapOperator[ReadRange->MapBatches(<lambda>)] completed. Operator Metrics:
   {'num_inputs_received': 20, 'bytes_inputs_received': 46440, 'num_task_inputs_processed': 20, 'bytes_task_inputs_processed': 46440, 'num_task_outputs_generated': 20, 'bytes_task_outputs_generated': 800, 'rows_task_outputs_generated': 100, 'num_outputs_taken': 20, 'bytes_outputs_taken': 800, 'num_outputs_of_finished_tasks': 20, 'bytes_outputs_of_finished_tasks': 800, 'num_tasks_submitted': 20, 'num_tasks_running': 0, 'num_tasks_have_outputs': 20, 'num_tasks_finished': 20, 'obj_store_mem_freed': 46440, 'obj_store_mem_spilled': 0, 'block_generation_time': 1.191296085, 'cpu_usage': 0, 'gpu_usage': 0, 'ray_remote_args': {'num_cpus': 1, 'scheduling_strategy': 'SPREAD'}}

This log file can be found locally at `/tmp/ray/{SESSION_NAME}/logs/ray-data/ray-data.log`. It can also be found on the Ray Dashboard under the head node's logs in the :ref:`Logs view <dash-logs-view>`.

.. _ray-data-stats:

Ray Data stats
--------------
To see detailed stats on the execution of a dataset you can use the :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.stats` method.

Operator stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The stats output includes a summary on the individual operator's execution stats for each operator. Ray Data calculates this
summary across many different blocks, so some stats show the min, max, mean, and sum of the stats aggregated over all the blocks.
The following are descriptions of the various stats included at the operator level:

* **Remote wall time**: The wall time is the start to finish time for an operator. It includes the time where the operator
  isn't processing data, sleeping, waiting for I/O, etc.
* **Remote CPU time**: The CPU time is the process time for an operator which excludes time slept. This time includes both
  user and system CPU time.
* **UDF time**: The UDF time is time spent in functions defined by the user. This time includes functions you pass into Ray
  Data methods, including :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.map`, :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.map_batches`, :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.filter`,
  etc. You can use this stat to track the time spent in functions you define and how much time optimizing those functions could save.
* **Memory usage**: The output displays memory usage per block in MiB.
* **Output stats**: The output includes stats on the number of rows output and size of output in bytes per block. The number of
  output rows per task is also included. All of this together gives you insight into how much data Ray Data is outputting at a per
  block and per task level.
* **Task Stats**: The output shows the scheduling of tasks to nodes, which allows you to see if you are utilizing all of your nodes
  as expected.
* **Throughput**: The summary calculates the throughput for the operator, and for a point of comparison, it also computes an estimate of
  the throughput of the same task on a single node. This estimate assumes the total time of the work remains the same, but with no
  concurrency. The overall summary also calculates the throughput at the dataset level, including a single node estimate.

Iterator stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you iterate over the data, Ray Data also generates iteration stats. Even if you aren't directly iterating over the data, you
might see iteration stats, for example, if you call :meth:`~ray.data.Dataset.take_all`. Some of the stats that Ray Data includes
at the iterator level are:

* **Iterator initialization**: The time Ray Data spent initializing the iterator. This time is internal to Ray Data.
* **Time user thread is blocked**: The time Ray Data spent producing data in the iterator. This time is often the primary execution of a
  dataset if you haven't previously materialized it.
* **Time in user thread**: The time spent in the user thread that's iterating over the dataset outside of the Ray Data code.
  If this time is high, consider optimizing the body of the loop that's iterating over the dataset.
* **Batch iteration stats**: Ray Data also includes stats about the prefetching of batches. These times are internal to Ray
  Data code, but you can further optimize this time by tuning the prefetching process.

Verbose stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default, Ray Data only logs the most important high-level stats. To enable verbose stats outputs, include
the following snippet in your Ray Data code:

.. testcode::

   from ray.data import DataContext

   context = DataContext.get_current()
   context.verbose_stats_logs = True


By enabling verbosity Ray Data adds a few more outputs:

* **Extra metrics**: Operators, executors, etc. can add to this dictionary of various metrics. There is
  some duplication of stats between the default output and this dictionary, but for advanced users this stat provides more
  insight into the dataset's execution.
* **Runtime metrics**: These metrics are a high-level breakdown of the runtime of the dataset execution. These stats are a per
  operator summary of the time each operator took to complete and the fraction of the total execution time that the operator took
  to complete. As there are potentially multiple concurrent operators, these percentages don't necessarily sum to 100%. Instead,
  they show how long running each of the operators is in the context of the full dataset execution.
