Exchanging Datasets
===================

Datasets can be passed to Ray tasks or actors and read with ``.iter_batches()`` or ``.iter_rows()``.
This does not incur a copy, since the blocks of the Dataset are passed by reference as Ray objects:

.. code-block:: python

    @ray.remote
    def consume(data: Dataset[int]) -> int:
        num_batches = 0
        for batch in data.iter_batches():
            num_batches += 1
        return num_batches

    ds = ray.data.range(10000)
    ray.get(consume.remote(ds))
    # -> 200

Datasets can be split up into disjoint sub-datasets.
Locality-aware splitting is supported if you pass in a list of actor handles to the ``split()`` function along with the number of desired splits.
This is a common pattern useful for loading and splitting data between distributed training actors:

.. code-block:: python

    @ray.remote(num_gpus=1)
    class Worker:
        def __init__(self, rank: int):
            pass

        def train(self, shard: ray.data.Dataset[int]) -> int:
            for batch in shard.iter_batches(batch_size=256):
                pass
            return shard.count()

    workers = [Worker.remote(i) for i in range(16)]
    # -> [Actor(Worker, ...), Actor(Worker, ...), ...]

    ds = ray.data.range(10000)
    # -> Dataset(num_blocks=200, num_rows=10000, schema=<class 'int'>)

    shards = ds.split(n=16, locality_hints=workers)
    # -> [Dataset(num_blocks=13, num_rows=650, schema=<class 'int'>),
    #     Dataset(num_blocks=13, num_rows=650, schema=<class 'int'>), ...]

    ray.get([w.train.remote(s) for w, s in zip(workers, shards)])
    # -> [650, 650, ...]
