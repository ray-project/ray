Scheduling, Execution, and Memory Management

Scheduling
==========

Datasets uses Ray core for execution, and hence is subject to the same scheduling considerations as normal Ray tasks and actors. Datasets uses the following custom scheduling settings by default for improved performance:

* The ``SPREAD`` scheduling strategy is used to ensure data blocks are evenly balanced across the cluster.
* Retries of application-level exceptions are enabled to handle transient errors from remote datasources.
* Dataset tasks ignore placement groups by default, see :ref:`Datasets and Placement Groups <datasets_pg>`.

Datasets and Tune
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Datasets in conjunction with :ref:`Ray Tune <tune-main>`, it is important to ensure there are enough free CPUs for Datasets to run on. By default, Tune will try to fully utilize cluster CPUs. This can prevent Datasets from scheduling tasks, reducing performance or causing workloads to hang.

As an example, the following shows two ways to use Datasets together with Tune:

.. tabbed:: Limiting Tune Concurrency

    By limiting the number of concurrent Tune trials, we ensure CPU resources are always available for Datasets execution.
    This can be done using the ``max_concurrent_trials`` Tune option.

    .. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/key_concepts.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: __resource_allocation_1_begin__
      :end-before: __resource_allocation_1_end__

.. tabbed:: Reserving CPUs (Experimental)

    Alternatively, we can tell Tune to set aside CPU resources for other libraries.
    This can be done by setting ``_max_cpu_fraction_per_node=0.8``, which reserves
    20% of node CPUs for Dataset execution.

    .. literalinclude:: ./doc_code/key_concepts.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: __resource_allocation_2_begin__
      :end-before: __resource_allocation_2_end__

    .. warning::

        This option is experimental and not currently recommended for use with
        autoscaling clusters (scale-up will not trigger properly).

.. _datasets_pg:

Datasets and Placement Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Datasets configures its tasks and actors to use the cluster-default scheduling strategy ("DEFAULT"). You can inspect this configuration variable here:
``ray.data.context.DatasetContext.get_current().scheduling_strategy``. This scheduling strategy will schedule these tasks and actors outside any present
placement group. If you want to force Datasets to schedule tasks within the current placement group (i.e., to use current placement group resources specifically for Datasets), you can set ``ray.data.context.DatasetContext.get_current().scheduling_strategy = None``.

This should be considered for advanced use cases to improve performance predictability only. We generally recommend letting Datasets run outside placement groups as documented in the :ref:`Datasets and Other Libraries <datasets_tune>` section.

Execution
=========

This section covers Dataset execution modes and performance considerations.

Lazy Execution Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, most Datasets operations are eager, which provides a simpler iterative
development experience. Datasets also has a lazy execution mode that can offer
improved performance due to stage fusion optimizations.

Lazy execution mode can be enabled by calling
:meth:`ds = ds.lazy() <ray.data.Dataset.lazy()>`, which
returns a Dataset whose all subsequent operations will be lazy. These operations
won't be executed until the dataset is consumed or
:meth:`ds.fully_executed() <ray.data.Dataset.fully_executed>` is called to manually
trigger execution.

Stage Fusion Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to reduce memory usage and task overheads, Datasets will automatically fuse together
lazy operations that are compatible:

* Same compute pattern: embarrassingly parallel map vs. all-to-all shuffle
* Same compute strategy: Ray tasks vs Ray actors
* Same resource specification, e.g. ``num_cpus`` or ``num_cpus`` requests

Read stages and subsequent map-like transformations will usually be fused together.
All-to-all transformations such as
:meth:`ds.random_shuffle() <ray.data.Dataset.random_shuffle>` can be fused with earlier
map-like stages, but not later stages.

You can tell if stage fusion is enabled by checking the :ref:`Dataset stats <data_performance_tips>` and looking for fused stages (e.g., ``read->map_batches``).

.. code-block::

    Stage N read->map_batches->shuffle_map: N/N blocks executed in T
    * Remote wall time: T min, T max, T mean, T total
    * Remote cpu time: T min, T max, T mean, T total
    * Output num rows: N min, N max, N mean, N total

To avoid unnecessary data movement in the distributed setting,
:class:`DatasetPipelines <ray.data.dataset_pipelines.DatasetPipeline>` will always use
lazy execution under the hood.

Memory Management
=================

This section describes how Datasets manages execution and object store memory.

Execution Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During execution, certain types of intermediate data must fit in memory. This includes the input block of a task, as well as at least one of the output blocks of the task (when a task has multiple output blocks, only one needs to fit in memory at any given time). The input block consumes object stored shared memory (and Python heap memory if conversion to non-Arrow format is needed). The output blocks consume Python heap memory (prior to putting in the object store) as well as object store memory (after being put in the object store).

This means that large block sizes can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, make sure no single item in your Datasets is too large, and always call :meth:`ds.map_batches() <ray.data.Dataset.map_batches>` with batch size small enough such that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.

Object Store Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Datasets uses the Ray object store to store data blocks, which means it inherits the memory management features of the Ray object store. This section discusses the relevant features:

* Object Spilling: Since Datasets uses the Ray object store to store data blocks, any blocks that can't fit into object store memory are automatically spilled to disk. The objects are automatically reloaded when needed by downstream compute tasks:
* Locality Scheduling: Ray will preferentially schedule compute tasks on nodes that already have a local copy of the object, reducing the need to transfer objects between nodes in the cluster.
* Reference Counting: Dataset blocks are kept alive by object store reference counting as long as there is any Dataset that references them. To free memory, delete any Python references to the Dataset object.

Block Data Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to optimize conversion costs, Datasets can hold tabular data in-memory
as either `Arrow Tables <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html>`__
or `Pandas DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`__.

Different ways of creating Datasets leads to a different starting internal format:

* Reading tabular files (Parquet, CSV, JSON) creates Arrow blocks initially.
* Converting from Pandas, Dask, Modin, and Mars creates Pandas blocks initially.
* Reading NumPy files or converting from NumPy ndarrays creates Arrow blocks.

However, this internal format is not exposed to the user. Datasets converts between formats
as needed internally depending on the specified ``batch_format`` of transformations.
