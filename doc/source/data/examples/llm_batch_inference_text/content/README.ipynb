In this use case, the batch inference job infers company industries from company names across a large customer dataset.\n\n\n## When to use LLM batch inference\n\nOffline (batch) inference optimizes for throughput over latency. Unlike online inference, which processes requests one at a time in real-time, batch inference processes thousands or millions of inputs together, maximizing GPU utilization and reducing per-inference costs.\n\nChoose batch inference when:\n- You have a fixed dataset to process (such as daily reports or data migrations).\n- Throughput matters more than immediate results.\n- You want to take advantage of fault tolerance for long-running jobs.\n\nOn the contrary, if you are more interested in optimizing for latency, consider [deploying your LLM with Ray Serve LLM for online inference](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/index.html)."

    "The `batch_size` parameter controls how many requests Ray Data sends to vLLM at once. vLLM uses continuous batching internally, controlled by `max_num_seqs` in `engine_kwargs`. This directly impacts GPU memory allocation since vLLM pre-allocates KV cache for up to `max_num_seqs` concurrent sequences.\n",

    "In this example, you built an end-to-end batch pipeline: loading a customer dataset from S3 into a Ray Dataset, configuring a vLLM processor for Llama 3.1 8&nbsp;B, and adding simple pre/post-processing to infer company industries. You validated the flow on 10,000 rows, scaled to 1M+ records, monitored progress in the Ray Dashboard, and saved the results to persistent storage.\n",
