In this use case, the batch inference job generates captions for a large-scale image dataset.\n\n## When to use LLM batch inference\n\nOffline (batch) inference optimizes for throughput over latency. Unlike online inference, which processes requests one at a time in real-time, batch inference processes thousands or millions of inputs together, maximizing GPU utilization and reducing per-inference costs.\n\nChoose batch inference when:\n- You have a fixed dataset to process (such as daily reports or data migrations).\n- Throughput matters more than immediate results.\n- You want to take advantage of fault tolerance for long-running jobs.\n\nOn the contrary, if you are more interested in optimizing for latency, consider [deploying your LLM with Ray Serve LLM for online inference](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/index.html).\n"

    "- *Available GPU count:* Start with the number of GPUs in your cluster. Each replica needs at least one GPU (more if using tensor parallelism).\n",
    "- *Model memory footprint:* Ensure your model fits in GPU memory. For example, an 8&nbsp;B parameter model in FP16 requires ~16&nbsp;GB, fitting on a single L4 (24&nbsp;GB) or A10G (24&nbsp;GB).\n",
    "- *CPU-bound preprocessing:* If preprocessing (image decoding, resizing) is slower than inference, adding more GPU replicas won't help. Check `stats()` output to identify if preprocessing is the bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tune batch size**  \n",
    "The `batch_size` parameter controls how many requests Ray Data sends to vLLM at once. vLLM uses continuous batching internally, controlled by `max_num_seqs` in `engine_kwargs`. This directly impacts GPU memory allocation since vLLM pre-allocates KV cache for up to `max_num_seqs` concurrent sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Too small `batch_size`:* vLLM scheduler is under-saturated, risking GPU idle time.\n",
    "- *Too large `batch_size`:* vLLM scheduler is over-saturated, causing overhead latency. Also increases retry cost on failure since the entire batch is retried.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try the following suggestions:\n",
    "1. Start with `batch_size` equal to `max_num_seqs` in your vLLM engine parameters. See [vLLM engine arguments](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/engine_args.html) for defaults.\n",
    "2. Monitor GPU utilization in the Ray Dashboard (see [Monitor the execution](#monitor-the-execution) section).\n",
    "3. Adjust `max_num_seqs` in `engine_kwargs` to optimize GPU utilization, and re-adapt `batch_size` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimize image loading**  \n",
    "Pre-resize images to a consistent size to reduce memory usage and improve throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tune preprocessing and inference stage parallelism**  \n",
    "Use `repartition()` to control parallelism during your preprocessing stage. On the other hand, the number of inference tasks is determined by `dataset_size / batch_size`, where `batch_size` controls how many rows are grouped for each vLLM engine call. Ensure you have enough tasks to keep all workers busy and enable efficient load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Configure parallelism for Ray Data LLM](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/batch-inference/resource-allocation/concurrency-and-batching.md) for detailed guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use quantization to reduce memory footprint**  \n",
    "Quantization reduces model precision to save GPU memory and improve throughput; vLLM supports this with the `quantization` field in `engine_kwargs`. Note that lower precision may impact output quality, and not all models or GPUs support all quantization types, see [Quantization for LLM batch inference](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/batch-inference/throughput-optimization/quantization.md) for more guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fault tolerance and checkpointing**  \n",
    "Ray Data automatically handles fault tolerance - if a worker fails, only that worker's current batch is retried. For long-running Anyscale Jobs, you can enable job-level checkpointing to resume from failures. See [Anyscale Runtime checkpointing documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/runtime/data#enable-job-level-checkpointing) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale to larger models with model parallelism**  \n",
    "Model parallelism distributes large models across multiple GPUs when they don't fit on a single GPU. Use tensor parallelism to split model layers horizontally across multiple GPUs within a single node and use pipeline parallelism to split model layers vertically across multiple nodes, with each node processing different layers of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward model parallelism parameters to your inference engine using the `engine_kwargs` argument of your `vLLMEngineProcessorConfig` object. If your GPUs span multiple nodes, set `ray` as the distributed executor backend to enable cross-node parallelism.
