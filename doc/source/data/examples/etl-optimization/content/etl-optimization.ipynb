        "- **Raw Layer**: The first stage stores unprocessed, ingested data exactly as it arrives, preserving fidelity and acting as a source of truth for traceability.\n",
        "- **Cleaned/Enriched Layer**: Here, data quality improvements, type conversions, deduplication, and light enrichment are performed. The result is standardized, trusted data, ready for analytical processing.\n",

        "Ray Data provides native write functions for various data warehouses and file formats, enabling you to export processed datasets directly to your target storage systems. You can write to Snowflake using `write_snowflake()`, which handles authentication and schema management automatically. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For other data warehouses, Ray Data supports writing to BigQuery with `write_bigquery()`, SQL databases with `write_sql()`, and modern table formats like Delta Lake (`write_delta()` and `write_unity_catalog()`, *coming soon*) and Apache Iceberg (`write_iceberg()`). Additionally, you can write to file-based formats such as Parquet using `write_parquet(),` which offers efficient columnar storage with compression options. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These native write functions integrate seamlessly with Ray Data's distributed processing, allowing you to scale data export operations across your cluster while maintaining data consistency and optimizing write performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "In modern enterprise environments, it's increasingly common to see a diversified ecosystem of data platforms and warehouses. Organizations routinely operate a mesh of tools, each optimized for different workloads and user profiles: Databricks for large-scale Spark processing, Snowflake for seamless and scalable SQL analytics, and platforms like Anyscale for machine learning and data pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "This heterogeneous landscape brings several benefits. By leveraging the unique strengths of each platform, enterprises can serve varied application types more efficiently—ranging from business reporting and ad hoc analytics to real-time machine learning and AI. It also provides flexibility, as teams are no longer forced into one-size-fits-all solutions, and can integrate with multiple data sources and sinks as their needs evolve.\n",
        " \n",
        "In this context, having native integrations with a variety of warehouses and analytic stores is not just common—it's a strategic advantage. Ray Data's ability to connect directly with popular systems like Snowflake, BigQuery, Delta Lake, and Parquet allows teams to build robust, production-grade pipelines while taking full advantage of the specialized capabilities of each data platform in their stack.\n"
