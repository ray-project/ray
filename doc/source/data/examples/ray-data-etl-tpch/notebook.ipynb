    "## Part 4: Transform - Processing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Transform** phase is where the real data processing happens. Ray Data provides several transformation operations that can be applied to datasets, and understanding how they work under the hood is key to building efficient ETL pipelines that power modern AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformations for the AI Era\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI workloads require more than traditional data transformations. Ray Data is designed for the era of **compound AI systems** and **agentic workflows** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b> AI-Powered Transformations:</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Multimodal Processing:</b> Simultaneously process text, images, video, and audio</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Model Inference:</b> Embed ML models directly into transformation pipelines</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>GPU Acceleration:</b> Seamlessly utilize both CPU and GPU resources</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Compound AI:</b> Orchestrate multiple models and traditional ML within single workflows</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>AI-Enhanced ETL:</b> Use AI to optimize every aspect of data processing</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Ray Data Processes Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you apply transformations with Ray Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Distribution**: Transformations are distributed across Ray tasks/actors\n",
    "2. **Block-level Processing**: Each task processes one or more blocks independently  \n",
    "3. **Streaming Execution**: Blocks flow through the pipeline without waiting for all data\n",
    "4. **Operator Fusion**: Compatible operations are automatically combined for efficiency\n",
    "5. **Heterogeneous Compute**: Intelligently schedules CPU and GPU work\n",
    "6. **Fault Tolerance**: Failed tasks are automatically retried\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture enables Ray Data to handle everything from traditional business logic to cutting-edge AI inference within the same pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b> Transformation Categories:</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Row-wise operations:</b> <code>map()</code> - Transform individual rows</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Batch operations:</b> <code>map_batches()</code> - Transform groups of rows (ideal for ML inference)</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Filtering:</b> <code>filter()</code> - Remove rows based on conditions</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Aggregations:</b> <code>groupby()</code> - Group and aggregate data</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Joins:</b> <code>join()</code> - Combine datasets</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>AI Operations:</b> Embed models for inference, embeddings, and feature extraction</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Shuffling:</b> <code>random_shuffle()</code>, <code>sort()</code> - Reorder data</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "While most other data frameworks support similar map operations through UDFs, with Ray Data, these are treated as first-class supported features. Instead of just arbitrary operations sent to partitions, Ray Data has several key advantages:\n",
    "- Each task can have task-level concurrency and hardware allocation set instead of just global settings for all UDFs.\n",
    "- These tasks support PyArrow, pandas, and NumPy format, which provides easy integrations to the rest of the Python ecosystem.\n",
    "- These tasks support stateful actors, which supports initializing expensive steps like downloading an AI model, only once per replica instead of per-invocation.\n",
    "- For more advanced use cases, Ray Core can be run inside of the task, supporting nested parallelism algorithms. This is useful for HPC-style applications with complicated compute tasks on top of big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b> GPU Optimizations:</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Nvidia RAPIDS:</b> <code>map_batches()</code> - Pandas ETL operations can be sped up using the Nvidia cuDF library to run the slower sections of ETL logic onto GPUs.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Batch Inference:</b> <code>map_batches()</code> - GPU AI batch inference can be used for unstructured data ingestion or LLM processing, amongst many other use cases</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>AI Training:</b> - Many data pipelines, such as time series analysis, train many small models over sections of the data. These smaller ML models, such as XGBoost models, can be trained using GPUs for faster performance</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
