    "### Understanding ETL\n",
    "\n",
    "**ETL** stands for Extract, Transform, Load - a fundamental pattern in data engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract**: Reading data from various sources (databases, files, APIs, etc.)\n",
    "- **Transform**: Processing, cleaning, and enriching the data\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Datasets and blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Dataset** in Ray Data is a distributed collection of data that's divided into **blocks**. Think of blocks as chunks of your data that can be processed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Understanding blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each block contains a subset of your data (typically 1-128 MB).\n",
    "- Ray Data stores blocks in Ray's distributed object store.\n",
    "- Ray Data applies operations to blocks in parallel across the cluster.\n",

    "Ray Data uses **lazy execution** by default, meaning it doesn't execute operations immediately but plans and optimizes before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lazy execution benefits:**\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Ray Data can optimize the entire pipeline before execution\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Data also utilizes **streaming execution**, which helps combine the best of structured streaming and batch inference.

    "### How Ray Data reads data under the hood\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read data with Ray Data, the following happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File discovery**: Ray Data discovers all files matching your path pattern.\n",
    "2. **Task creation**: Ray Data distributes files across Ray tasks (typically one file per task).\n",
    "3. **Parallel reading**: Multiple tasks read files simultaneously across the cluster.\n",
    "4. **Block creation**: Each task creates data blocks stored in Ray's object store.\n",
    "5. **Lazy planning**: Ray Data creates the dataset but doesn't load the data until needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note: Built-in data sources**\n",

    "- **Structured**: Parquet, CSV, JSON, Arrow\n",
    "- **Unstructured**: Images, videos, audio, binary files\n",
    "- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake\n",
    "- **Cloud storage**: S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "- **Data lakes**: Delta Lake, Iceberg (with RayTurbo)\n",
    "- **ML formats**: TensorFlow Records, PyTorch datasets\n",
    "- **Memory**: Python lists, NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames\n",

    "## Part 4: Transform - processing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Transform** phase is where the real data processing happens. Ray Data provides several transformation operations that you can apply to datasets, and understanding how they work under the hood is key to building efficient ETL pipelines that power modern AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformations for the AI era\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI workloads require more than traditional data transformations. Ray Data is designed for the era of **compound AI systems** and **agentic workflows** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip: AI-powered transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multimodal processing**: Simultaneously process text, images, video, and audio.\n",
    "- **Model inference**: Embed ML models directly into transformation pipelines.\n",
    "- **GPU acceleration**: Seamlessly utilize both CPU and GPU resources.\n",
    "- **Compound AI**: Orchestrate multiple models and traditional ML within single workflows.\n",
    "- **AI-enhanced ETL**: Use AI to optimize every aspect of data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Ray Data processes transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you apply transformations with Ray Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task distribution**: Ray Data distributes transformations across Ray tasks/actors.\n",
    "2. **Block-level processing**: Each task processes one or more blocks independently.\n",
    "3. **Streaming execution**: Blocks flow through the pipeline without waiting for all data.\n",
    "4. **Operator fusion**: Compatible operations are automatically combined for efficiency.\n",
    "5. **Heterogeneous compute**: Intelligently schedules CPU and GPU work.\n",
    "6. **Fault tolerance**: Ray Data automatically retries failed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture enables Ray Data to handle everything from traditional business logic to cutting-edge AI inference within the same pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Transformation categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row-wise operations**: `map()` - Transform individual rows\n",
    "- **Batch operations**: `map_batches()` - Transform groups of rows (ideal for ML inference)\n",
    "- **Filtering**: `filter()` - Remove rows based on conditions\n",
    "- **Aggregations**: `groupby()` - Group and aggregate data\n",
    "- **Joins**: `join()` - Combine datasets\n",
    "- **AI operations**: Embed models for inference, embeddings, and feature extraction\n",
    "- **Shuffling**: `random_shuffle()`, `sort()` - Reorder data\n",
    "\n",
    "While most other data frameworks support similar map operations through UDFs, with Ray Data, these are treated as first-class supported features. Instead of sending arbitrary operations to partitions, Ray Data has several key advantages:\n",
    "- Each task can have task-level concurrency and hardware allocation set instead of global settings for all UDFs.\n",
    "- These tasks support PyArrow, pandas, and NumPy format, which provides easy integrations to the rest of the Python ecosystem.\n",
    "- These tasks support stateful actors, which supports initializing expensive steps like downloading an AI model, only once per replica instead of per-invocation.\n",
    "- For more advanced use cases, you can run Ray Core inside of the task, supporting nested parallelism algorithms. This is useful for HPC-style applications with complicated compute tasks on top of big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip: GPU optimizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nvidia RAPIDS**: `map_batches()` - You can speed up pandas ETL operations using the Nvidia cuDF library to run the slower sections of ETL logic onto GPUs.\n",
    "- **Batch inference**: `map_batches()` - You can use GPU AI batch inference for unstructured data ingestion or LLM processing, amongst many other use cases.\n",
    "- **AI training**: Many data pipelines, such as time series analysis, train many small models over sections of the data. You can train these smaller ML models, such as XGBoost models, using GPUs for faster performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on traditional CPU-based ETL workloads, but there are other templates available for batch inference using GPUs if you're interested in learning more."
