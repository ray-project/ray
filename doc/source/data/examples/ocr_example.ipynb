    "# Scaling OCR using Ray Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will show you how to run optical character recognition (OCR) on a set of documents and analyze the resulting text with the natural language processing library [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Running OCR on a large dataset is very computationally expensive, so using Ray for distributed processing can really speed up the analysis. Ray Data makes it easy to compose the different steps of the pipeline, namely the OCR and the natural language processing. Ray Data' actor support also allows us to be more efficient by sharing the spaCy NLP context between several datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more interesting, we will run the analysis on the [LightShot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/lightshot) dataset. It is a large publicly available OCR dataset with a wide variety of different documents, all of them screenshots of various forms. It is easy to replace that dataset with your own data and adapt the example to your own use cases!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover:\n",
    " - Creating a Datastream that represents the images in the dataset\n",
    " - Running the computationally expensive OCR process on each image in the datastream in parallel\n",
    " - Filtering the datastream by keeping only images that contain text\n",
    " - Performing various NLP operations on the text\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by preparing the dependencies and downloading the dataset. First we install the OCR software `tesseract` and its Python client:\n",
    "\n",
    "``````{tab-set}\n",
    "\n",
    "````{tab-item} macOS\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install tesseract\n",
    "pip install pytesseract\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "````{tab-item} linux\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr\n",
    "pip install pytesseract\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "``````\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the following example will run on a tiny dataset we provide. If you want to run it on the full dataset, we recommend to run it on a cluster since processing all the images with tesseract takes a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "If you want to run the example on the full [LightShot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/lightshot) dataset, you need to download the dataset and extract it. You can extract the dataset by first running `unzip archive.zip` and then `unrar x LightShot13k.rar .` and then you can upload the dataset to S3 with `aws s3 cp LightShot13k/ s3://<bucket>/<folder> --recursive`.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now import Ray and initialize a local Ray cluster. If you want to run OCR at a very large scale, you should run this workload on a multi-node cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import ray and initialize a local Ray cluster.\n",
    "import ray\n",
    "ray.init()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the OCR software on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use the {meth}`ray.data.read_binary_files <ray.data.read_binary_files>` function to read all the images from S3. We set the `include_paths=True` option to create a datastream of the S3 paths and image contents. We then run the {meth}`ds.map <ray.data.Datastream.map>` function on this datastream to execute the actual OCR process on each file and convert the screen shots into text. This will create a tabular datastream with columns `path` and `text`, see also [](transforming_data).\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "If you want to load the data from a private bucket, you have to run\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyarrow.fs\n",
    "\n",
    "ds = ray.data.read_binary_files(\"s3://<bucket>/<folder>\",\n",
    "    include_paths=True,\n",
