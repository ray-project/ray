.. note::

    Ray 2.10.0 introduces the alpha stage of RLlib's "new API stack".
    The Ray Team plans to transition algorithms, example scripts, and documentation to the new code base
    thereby incrementally replacing the "old API stack" (e.g., ModelV2, Policy, RolloutWorker) throughout the subsequent minor releases leading up to Ray 3.0.

    :doc:`See here </rllib/rllib-new-api-stack>` for more details on how to use the new API stack.
