.. note::

    Ray 2.40 uses RLlib's new API stack by default.
    The Ray team has mostly completed transitioning algorithms, example scripts, and
    documentation to the new code base.

    If you're still using the old API stack, see :doc:`New API stack migration guide </rllib/new-api-stack-migration-guide>` for details on how to migrate.
