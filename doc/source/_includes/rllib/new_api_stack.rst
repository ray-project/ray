.. note::

    Ray 2.10.0 introduces the alpha stage of RLlib's "new API stack" (tagged in the docs with |new_stack_small|).
    The Ray RLlib Team is currently transitioning algorithms, example scripts, and
    documentation to the new code base thereby incrementally replacing the "old API stack"
    (tagged in the docs with |old_stack_small|) throughout the subsequent minor releases leading up to Ray 3.0.

    So far, PPO, SAC, DQN (all single- and multi-agent), and DreamerV3 (single-agent only)
    support the "new API stack", but - by default - continue to run with the old APIs.
    :doc:`See here </rllib/rllib-new-api-stack>` for more details on how to activate and use the
    new API stack for these algorithms.
