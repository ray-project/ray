.. note::

    Ray 2.40 uses :doc:`RLlib's new API stack </rllib/rllib-new-api-stack>` by default.
    The team has mostly completed transitioning algorithms, example scripts, and
    documentation to the new code base.

    In case you are still using the old API stack, :doc:`see here </rllib/new-api-stack-migration-guide>` for more details on how to migrate.
