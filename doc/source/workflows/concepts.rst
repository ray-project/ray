Workflows: Fast, Durable Application Flows
==========================================

.. warning::

  Workflows is available as **alpha** in Ray 1.7+. Expect rough corners and for its APIs and storage format to change. Please file feature requests and bug reports on GitHub Issues or join the discussion on the `Ray Slack <https://forms.gle/9TSdDYUgxYs8SA9e8>`__.

Ray Workflows provides high-performance, *durable* application workflows using Ray tasks as the underlying execution engine. It is intended to support both large-scale workflows (e.g., ML and data pipelines) and long-running business workflows (when used together with Ray Serve).

Why Workflows?
--------------

**Flexibility:** Combine the flexibility of Ray's dynamic task graphs with strong durability guarantees. Branch or loop conditionally based on runtime data. Use Ray distributed libraries seamlessly within workflow tasks.

**Performance:** Workflows offers sub-second overheads for task launch and supports workflows with hundreds of thousands of tasks. Take advantage of the Ray object store to pass distributed datasets between tasks with zero-copy overhead.

**Dependency management:** Workflows leverages Ray's runtime environment feature to snapshot the code dependencies of a workflow. This enables management of workflows and virtual actors as code is upgraded over time.

You might find that workflows is *lower level* compared to engines such as `AirFlow <https://www.astronomer.io/blog/airflow-ray-data-science-story>`__ (which can also run on Ray). This is because workflows focuses more on core workflow primitives as opposed to tools and integrations.

Concepts
--------
Workflows provides the *task* and *virtual actor* durable primitives, which are analogous to Ray's non-durable tasks and actors.

Ray DAG
~~~~~~~

If youâ€™re brand new to Ray, we recommend starting with the :ref:`walkthrough <core-walkthrough>`.

Normally, Ray tasks are executed eagerly.
Ray DAG provides a way to build the DAG without execution, and Ray Workflow is based on Ray DAGs.

It is simple to build a Ray DAG: you just replace all ``.remote(...)`` with ``.bind(...)`` in a Ray application.
Ray DAGs can be composed in arbitrarily like normal Ray tasks.

Unlike Ray tasks, you are not allowed to call ``ray.get()`` or ``ray.wait()`` on DAGs.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Composing functions together into a DAG:

    import ray

    @ray.remote
    def one() -> int:
        return 1

    @ray.remote
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b

    dag = add.bind(100, one.bind())


Workflows
~~~~~~~~~

It takes a single line of code to turn a DAG into a workflow DAG:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Turning the DAG into a workflow DAG:

    from ray import workflow

    output: "Workflow[int]" = workflow.create(dag)

Execute the workflow DAG by ``<workflow>.run()`` or ``<workflow>.run_async()``. Once started, a workflow's execution is durably logged to storage. On system failure, workflows can be resumed on any Ray cluster with access to the storage.

When executing the workflow DAG, remote functions are retried on failure, but once they finish successfully and the results are persisted by the workflow engine, they will never be run again.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Run the workflow:

    # configure the storage with "ray.init". A default temporary storage is used by
    # by the workflow if starting without Ray init.
    ray.init(storage="/tmp/data")
    assert output.run(workflow_id="run_1") == 101
    assert workflow.get_status("run_1") == workflow.WorkflowStatus.SUCCESSFUL
    assert workflow.get_output("run_1") == 101

Objects
~~~~~~~
Large data objects can be stored in the Ray object store. References to these objects can be passed into and returned from tasks. Objects are checkpointed when initially returned from a task. After checkpointing, the object can be shared among any number of workflow tasks at memory-speed via the Ray object store.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Using Ray objects in a workflow:

    import ray
    from typing import List

    @ray.remote
    def hello():
        return "hello"

    @ray.remote
    def words() -> List[ray.ObjectRef]:
        # NOTE: Here it is ".remote()" instead of ".bind()", so
        # it creates an ObjectRef instead of a DAG.
        return [hello.remote(), ray.put("world")]

    @ray.remote
    def concat(words: List[ray.ObjectRef]) -> str:
        return " ".join([ray.get(w) for w in words])

    assert workflow.create(concat.bind(words.bind())).run() == "hello world"

Dynamic Workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Workflows can generate new tasks at runtime. This is achieved by returning a continuation of a DAG.
A continuation is something returned by a function and executed after it returns.
The continuation feature enables nesting, looping, and recursion within workflows.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: The Fibonacci recursive workflow:

    @ray.remote
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b

    @ray.remote
    def fib(n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        # return a continuation of a DAG
        return workflow.continuation(add.bind(fib.bind(n - 1), fib.bind(n - 2)))

    assert workflow.create(fib.bind(10)).run() == 55

Virtual Actors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Virtual actors have their state durably logged to workflow storage. This enables the management of long-running business workflows. Virtual actors can launch sub-workflows from method calls and receive timer-based and externally triggered events.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: A persistent virtual actor counter:

    @workflow.virtual_actor
    class Counter:
        def __init__(self):
            self.count = 0

        def incr(self):
            self.count += 1
            return self.count

    ray.init(storage="/tmp/data")
    c1 = Counter.get_or_create("counter_1")
    assert c1.incr.run() == 1
    assert c1.incr.run() == 2

Events
~~~~~~
Workflows can be efficiently triggered by timers or external events using the event system.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Using events.

    # Sleep is a special type of event.
    sleep_task = workflow.sleep(100)

    # `wait_for_events` allows for pluggable event listeners.
    event_task = workflow.wait_for_event(MyEventListener)

    @ray.remote
    def gather(*args):
        return args

    # If a task's arguments include events, the task won't be executed until all of the events have occured.
    workflow.create(gather.bind(sleep_task, event_task, "hello world")).run()
