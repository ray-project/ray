Workflow Management
===================

Workflow IDs
------------
Each workflow has a unique ``workflow_id``. By default, when you call ``.run()``
or ``.run_async()``, a random id is generated. It is recommended that you
explicitly assign each workflow an id via ``.run(workflow_id="id")``.

If ``.run()`` is called with a previously created workflow id, the workflow will be resumed from the previous execution.

Workflow Status
---------------
A workflow can be in one of several statuses:

=================== =======================================================================================
Status              Description
=================== =======================================================================================
RUNNING             The workflow is currently running in the cluster.
PENDING             The workflow is queued and waiting to be executed.
FAILED              This workflow failed with an application error. It can be resumed from the failed task.
RESUMABLE           This workflow failed with a system error. It can be resumed from the failed task.
CANCELED            The workflow was canceled. Its result is unavailable, and it cannot be resumed.
SUCCESSFUL          The workflow has been executed successfully.

        print("Workflow doesn't exist.")

    # Resume a workflow.
    print(workflow.resume(workflow_id="workflow_id"))

    # Cancel a workflow.

Bulk workflow management APIs
-----------------------------

.. testcode::

    # List all running workflows.
    print(workflow.list_all("RUNNING"))

    # List RUNNING and CANCELED workflows.
    print(workflow.list_all({"RUNNING", "CANCELED"}))

    # List all workflows.
    print(workflow.list_all())

    # Resume all resumable workflows. This won't include failed workflow
    print(workflow.resume_all())

    # To resume workflows including failed ones, use `include_failed=True`
    print(workflow.resume_all(include_failed=True))

.. testoutput::
    :options: +MOCK

    [("workflow_id_1", "RUNNING"), ("workflow_id_2", "RUNNING")]
    [("workflow_id_1", "RUNNING"), ("workflow_id_2", "CANCELED")]
    [("workflow_id_1", "RUNNING"), ("workflow_id_2", "CANCELED")]
    [("workflow_id_1", ObjectRef), ("workflow_id_2", ObjectRef)]
    [("workflow_id_1", ObjectRef), ("workflow_id_3", ObjectRef)]

Recurring workflows
-------------------

Ray Workflows currently has no built-in job scheduler. You can however easily use
any external job scheduler to interact with your Ray cluster
(via :ref:`job submission <jobs-overview>`)
to trigger workflow runs.

Storage Configuration
---------------------
Ray Workflows supports multiple types of storage backends out of the box, including:

*  Local file system: Data is stored locally. This option is only suitable for single node testing,
   as the data must be stored on a shared file system (such as NFS) for use with multi-node clusters.
   To use local storage, specify ``ray.init(storage="/path/to/storage_dir")`` or
   ``ray start --head --storage="/path/to/storage_dir"``.
*  S3: This is a popular choice for production environments, as it offers scalable and durable object storage.
   Enable S3 storage with ``ray.init(storage="s3://bucket/path")`` or ``ray start --head --storage="s3://bucket/path"``.

Ray utilizes pyarrow internally as the storage engine. For a full list of storage options supported by pyarrow, please refer to the documentation at `Pyarrow.fs.FileSystem`_.

.. _Pyarrow.fs.FileSystem: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.fs.FileSystem.html#pyarrow.fs.FileSystem

.. note::
    If you are having trouble using a storage option that is supported by pyarrow,
    make sure that you have the correct version of pyarrow installed.
    For example, GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is only supported in pyarrow >= 9.0.

If left unspecified, ``/tmp/ray/workflow_data`` will be used for temporary storage. This default setting *will only work for single-node Ray clusters*.

Concurrency Control
-------------------
Ray Workflows supports concurrency control. You can support the maximum running
workflows and maximum pending workflows via ``workflow.init()`` before executing
any workflow. ``workflow.init()`` again with a different configuration would
raise an error except ``None`` is given.

For example, ``workflow.init(max_running_workflows=10, max_pending_workflows=50)``
means there will be at most 10 workflows running, and 50 workflows pending. And
calling with different values on another driver will raise an exception. If
they are set to be ``None``, it'll use the previous value set.

Submitting workflows when the number of pending workflows is at maximum would raise ``queue.Full("Workflow queue has been full")``. Getting the output of a pending workflow would be blocked until the workflow finishes running later.

A pending workflow has the ``PENDING`` status. After the pending workflow gets interrupted (e.g., a cluster failure), it can be resumed.
When resuming interrupted workflows that were running and pending with ``workflow.resume_all()``, running workflows have higher priority than pending workflows (i.e. the pending workflows would still likely be pending).

.. note::

  Workflows does not guarantee that resumed workflows are run in the same order .
