    "# Scaling Many Model Training with Ray Tune\n",
    "\n",
    "This template is a quickstart to using [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) for batch inference. Ray Tune is one of many libraries under the [Ray AI Runtime](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/getting-started.html). See [this blog post](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/training-one-million-machine-learning-models-in-record-time-with-ray) for more information on the benefits of performing many model training with Ray!\n",
    "\n",
    "This template walks through time-series forecasting using `statsforecast`, but the framework and data format can be swapped out easily -- they are there just to help you build your own application!\n",
