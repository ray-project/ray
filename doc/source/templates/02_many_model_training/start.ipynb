    "# Scaling Many Model Training with Ray Tune\n",
    "\n",
    "| Template Specification | Description |\n",
    "| ---------------------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| Summary | This template demonstrates how to parallelize the training of hundreds of time-series forecasting models with [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html). The template uses the `statsforecast` library to fit models to partitions of the M4 forecasting competition dataset. |\n",
    "| Time to Run | Around 5 minutes to train all models. |\n",
    "| Minimum Compute Requirements | No hard requirements. The default is 8 nodes with 8 CPUs each. |\n",
    "| Cluster Environment | This template uses the latest Anyscale-provided Ray ML image using Python 3.9: [`anyscale/ray-ml:latest-py39-gpu`](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/base-images/overview), with some extra requirements from `requirements.txt` installed on top. If you want to change to a different cluster environment, make sure that it is based off of this image and includes all packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result of the template is fitting multiple models on each dataset partition, then determining the best model based on cross-validation metrics. Then, using the best model, we can generate forecasts like the ones shown below:\n",

    "![Forecasts](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/3887863/239091118-2413f399-4636-40cf-8b12-8d3ce15f5ce1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In many model training, the focus is on training models on multiple subsets of\n",
    "a dataset, rather than training a single model on the entire dataset. Each model is trained on an independent\n",
    "dataset partition, allowing Ray to parallelize the workload by running multiple\n",
    "training jobs concurrently, instead of sequentially training each model.\n"
