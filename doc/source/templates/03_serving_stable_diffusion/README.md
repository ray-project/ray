# Serving a Stable Diffusion Model with Ray Serve

This guide is a quickstart to use [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) for model serving. Ray Serve is one of many libraries under the [Ray AI Runtime](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-air/getting-started.html).

This template loads a pretrained stable diffusion model from HuggingFace and serves it to a local endpoint as a Ray Serve deployment. 

Start coding by clicking on the Jupyter or VSCode icon above.
