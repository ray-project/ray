    "| Minimum Compute Requirements | No hard requirements. The default is 4 nodes, each with 1 NVIDIA T4 GPU. |\n",
    "| Cluster Environment | This template uses the latest Anyscale-provided Ray ML image using Python 3.9: [`anyscale/ray-ml:latest-py39-gpu`](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/base-images/overview). If you want to change to a different cluster environment, make sure that it is based off of this image! |\n"
