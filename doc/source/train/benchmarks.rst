Ray Train Benchmarks
====================

Below we document key performance benchmarks for common Ray Train tasks and workflows.

.. _pytorch_gpu_training_benchmark:

GPU image training
------------------

This task uses the TorchTrainer module to train different amounts of data
using an Pytorch ResNet model.

We test out the performance across different cluster sizes and data sizes.

- `GPU image training script`_
- `GPU training small cluster configuration`_
- `GPU training large cluster configuration`_

.. note::

    For multi-host distributed training, on AWS we need to ensure ec2 instances are in the same VPC and
    all ports are open in the secure group.

      - `python pytorch_training_e2e.py --data-size-gb=100 --num-workers=16`

.. _pytorch-training-parity:

Pytorch Training Parity
-----------------------

This task checks the performance parity between native Pytorch Distributed and
Ray Train's distributed TorchTrainer.

We demonstrate that the performance is similar (within 2.5\%) between the two frameworks.
Performance may vary greatly across different model, hardware, and cluster configurations.

The reported times are for the raw training times. There is an unreported constant setup
overhead of a few seconds for both methods that is negligible for longer training runs.

- `Pytorch comparison CPU cluster configuration`_
- `Pytorch comparison GPU cluster configuration`_

.. _tf-training-parity:

Tensorflow Training Parity
--------------------------

This task checks the performance parity between native Tensorflow Distributed and
Ray Train's distributed TensorflowTrainer.

We demonstrate that the performance is similar (within 1\%) between the two frameworks.
Performance may vary greatly across different model, hardware, and cluster configurations.

The reported times are for the raw training times. There is an unreported constant setup
overhead of a few seconds for both methods that is negligible for longer training runs.

.. note:: The batch size and number of epochs is different for the GPU benchmark, resulting in a longer runtime.
