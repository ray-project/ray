    "## How to migrate this computer vision workload to a distributed setup using Ray on Anyscale\n",
    "In this tutorial, you start with a small PyTorch-based image classification task—training a ResNet-18 model on a 10% slice of the Food-101 dataset, and progressively migrate it into a fully distributed, fault-tolerant training job using **Ray Train on Anyscale**. The goal is to show you exactly how to scale *your existing workflow* without rewriting it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following steps to migrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocess data and persist it in a distributed-friendly format**  \n",
    "   You take raw images from Hugging Face's `food101` dataset, apply `torchvision` resizing and center-cropping, and serialize them to **Parquet** using `pyarrow`. The system writes these Parquet files to the **Anyscale cluster's shared storage volume** (`/mnt/cluster_storage`), so any node can access them, on any worker, without duplication or sync issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a lightweight PyTorch `Dataset` for Parquet ingestion**  \n",
    "   You implement a custom `Food101Dataset` that reads directly from the Parquet files. This provides control over the way the system reads rows and row groups. While this isn't yet fully distributed, it allows you to simulate a real-world scenario where a developer starts with something simple before optimizing. **Note:** you use PyTorch style data loading in this tutorial to demonstrate (1) low level control in a PyTorch native environment and (2) how to move pre-existing PyTorch code into a distributed Anyscale environment. Other tutorials in this module incorporate Ray Data, so you can see how the two approaches differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integrate Ray Train into the training loop**  \n",
    "   You encapsulate your existing PyTorch training logic in a `train_loop_per_worker()` function, which Ray Train executes on each worker, typically one per GPU. Inside this loop, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Wrap the model with `prepare_model()` to make it compatible with distributed data parallelism.  \n",
    "   - Wrap the `DataLoader` with `prepare_data_loader()` to enable device placement and Ray worker context handling.  \n",
    "   - Use Ray's `Checkpoint` API to save and resume from checkpoints as needed.  \n",
    "   - Report training and validation metrics with `train.report()` after each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Launch training with `TorchTrainer` on an Anyscale cluster**  \n",
    "   You instantiate a `TorchTrainer` that runs:\n",
    "   - With `num_workers=8` and `use_gpu=True`. For example, across eight A10 or A100 GPUs on Anyscale. Please note that this amount of compute is not necessary for the example in this tutorial, as the excess resources are for educational purposes only.  \n",
    "   - With `RunConfig` that sets checkpoint retention and auto-resume (with `max_failures=3`).  \n",
    "   - On infrastructure that's provisioned and scheduled by Anyscale with no manual Ray cluster setup required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Once launched, Ray automatically handles:\n",
    "   - Multi-node orchestration  \n",
    "   - Worker assignment and device pinning  \n",
    "   - Failure recovery and retry logic  \n",
    "   - Checkpointing and logging\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Validate fault tolerance**  \n",
    "   You run `trainer.fit()` a second time. If manual intervention or failure interrupts the previous training, Ray picks up from the latest checkpoint. This shows **real-world robustness** without any manual checkpoint management or scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Launch distributed GPU inference tasks**  \n",
    "   At the end, you provide inference with a Ray Data pipeline that loads the best checkpoint and runs inference on a single image from the validation set. You run this task on one GPU from the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this runs inside a **managed Anyscale workspace**. You don't need to start or SSH into clusters, worry about node IP, or configure NCCL. The entire setup is **declarative and self-contained in this notebook**, and you can re-run it or scale it up by changing a single parameter (`num_workers`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial mirrors how many ML teams operate in practice: starting with a working PyTorch training loop and migrating it to the cloud without rewriting core logic. With Ray Train on Anyscale, the migration is clean, incremental, and production-ready."

    "\n",
    "- **Checkpoints** are first written to a fast **temporary local directory** on each worker, then safely persisted to the run’s configured `storage_path` by `train.report()`—ensuring reliability and retry support even under transient node failures.  \n",
    "- **Metrics** (train and validation loss) are automatically collected and stored by Ray Train—no need for manual file writes or JSON logging.  \n",
    "- **Fault tolerance** is fully handled by Ray Train’s checkpointing and retry mechanism via `RunConfig` and `FailureConfig`.  \n",
    "- **Final accuracy** is computed using `torchmetrics.MulticlassAccuracy`, which performs synchronized, **distributed accuracy aggregation** across all workers, ensuring a correct global metric instead of rank-0-only evaluation.  \n",

    "You've taken a realistic computer-vision workload, from raw images all the way to distributed training and GPU inference, and run it on Ray Train with zero boilerplate around GPUs, data parallelism, or fault-tolerance. This tutorial demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using **Ray Train's TorchTrainer** to scale PyTorch training across multiple GPUs and nodes with minimal code changes.  \n",
    "* Wrapping models and data loaders with **`prepare_model()`** and **`prepare_data_loader()`** to enable Ray-managed device placement and distributed execution.  \n",
    "* Sharding data across workers and coordinating training epochs across Ray workers.  \n",
    "* Configuring **automatic checkpointing and failure recovery** using Ray Train's built-in `Checkpoint`, `RunConfig`, and `FailureConfig` APIs.  \n",
    "* Running **Ray Data-based inference** for distributed inference, showing how to serve and scale model predictions across a Ray cluster.  \n",

    "## Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few directions you might explore to adapt or extend the pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Larger or custom datasets**  \n",
    "   * Swap in the full 75 k-image Food-101 split—or your own dataset in any storage backend (S3, GCS, Azure Blob).  \n",
    "   * Add multi-file Parquet sharding and let each worker read a different shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model architectures**  \n",
    "   * Drop in Vision Transformers (`vit_b_16`, `vit_l_32`) or ConvNeXt; the prepare helpers work exactly the same.  \n",
    "   * Experiment with transfer learning versus training from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mixed precision and performance tuning**  \n",
    "   * Enable automatic mixed precision (`torch.cuda.amp`) or bfloat16 to speed up training and save memory.  \n",
    "   * Profile data-loading throughput and play with `num_workers`, prefetching, and caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter sweeps**  \n",
    "   * Wrap the training loop in **Ray Tune** to search over learning rates, augmentations, or optimizers.  \n",
    "   * Use Ray's integrated reporting to schedule early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data augmentation pipelines**  \n",
    "   * Integrate additional transforms inside the dataset class for image augmentation.  \n",
    "   * Compare CPU versus GPU-side augmentations for throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Distributed validation and metrics**  \n",
    "   * Replace your simple accuracy printout with more advanced metrics (F1, top-5 accuracy, confusion matrices).  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model serving**  \n",
    "   * Convert the remote inference helper into a **Ray Serve** deployment for low-latency online predictions.  \n",
    "   * Auto-scale replicas based on request volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **End-to-end MLOps**  \n",
    "   * Register checkpoints in a model registry (for example, MLflow, Weights & Biases, or Ray's built-in MLflow integration).  \n",
    "   * Schedule the notebook as a Ray Job or CI/CD pipeline for regular retraining runs."
