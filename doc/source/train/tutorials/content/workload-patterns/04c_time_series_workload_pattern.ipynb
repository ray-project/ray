    "\n",
    "1. **Migrate local CSV data to shared Parquet**  \n",
    "   Download the NYC taxi dataset as a CSV, resample it to 30-minute intervals, normalize the values, and save it as **Parquet shards** in a shared filesystem (`/mnt/cluster_storage`)—the default storage for Anyscale clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create sliding window generation for Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)**  \n",
    "   Create overlapping input and output windows (past to future) to train a forecasting model. While this preprocessing is local and sequential in this tutorial, it mirrors pipelines that parallelize with **Ray Data** in large-scale settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define a vanilla PyTorch function to use distributed Ray Train**  \n",
    "   Define a `train_loop_per_worker()` function and use **Ray Train** to launch **eight GPU workers** across the cluster. Each worker loads its own Parquet shard, trains independently under Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and reports live metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configure Ray for scalable cluster orchestration**  \n",
    "   Instead of managing GPUs or process groups manually, configure `ScalingConfig`, `RunConfig`, and `FailureConfig`. **Ray and Anyscale handle fault-tolerant execution across nodes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Perform distributed batch inference with Ray Data**  \n",
    "   Use **Ray Data** with stateful GPU actors to load the trained checkpoint once per worker and run scalable, parallel forecasts on the latest data windows.  \n",
    "   This enables **efficient, reusable, and fault-tolerant** inference across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern takes a local academic-style time-series workflow and scales it into a **cluster-resilient, fault-tolerant forecasting pipeline**, all while preserving your native PyTorch modeling code."
