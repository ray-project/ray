    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through the end-to-end process of **migrating a local XGBoost training pipeline to a distributed Ray cluster running on Anyscale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps make that transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store local data as remote data**  \n",
    "   Store the raw data as Parquet in a shared cloud directory and load it using **Ray Data**, which streams and shards the dataset across workers automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert a single-process to multi-worker training**  \n",
    "   Define a custom `train_func`, then let **Ray Train** spin up 16 distributed training workers (1 per CPU) and run `xgb.train` in parallel, each with its own data shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Ray for automated fault tolerance**  \n",
    "   With `RayTrainReportCallback` and `CheckpointConfig`, Ray saves checkpoints every 10 boosting rounds and can resume mid-training if any worker crashes or a job is re-launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Ray's cluster-scale abstractions**  \n",
    "   Skip the boilerplate of manually slicing datasets, coordinating workers, or building launch scripts. Instead, declare intent (with `ScalingConfig`, `RunConfig`, and `FailureConfig`) and let **Ray and Anyscale** manage the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use offline inference**  \n",
    "   Batch inference is done with **Ray Data** on CPU workers. This is useful for seamlessly evolving the pipeline to large-scale production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern turns a traditional single-node workflow into a scalable, resilient training pipeline with minimal code changes, and it works seamlessly on any cluster you provision through Anyscale."

    "\n",
    "3. **Feature engineering at scale**  \n",
    "   * Create new features using `Ray Dataset.map_batches`, such as terrain interactions or log-scaled distances.  \n",
    "   * Materialize multiple Parquet shards and benchmark load time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model interpretability**  \n",
    "   * Use XGBoost's built-in `Booster.get_score` for feature attributions.  \n",
    "   * Rank features by importance and validate with domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Serving the model**  \n",
    "   * Package the Booster as a Ray task or **Ray Serve** endpoint.  \n",
    "   * Deploy an API that takes a feature vector and returns the predicted cover type.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Real-time logging**  \n",
    "   * Integrate with MLflow or Weights & Biases to store logs, plots, and checkpoints.  \n",
    "   * Use tags and metadata to track experiments over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Alternative objectives**  \n",
    "   * Try a binary objective (for example, presence versus absence of a species) or regression target (for example, canopy height).  \n",
    "   * Fine-tune loss functions for specific ecological tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **End-to-end MLOps**  \n",
