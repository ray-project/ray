    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|Need to speed up or scale up training| Training jobs might take a long time to complete, or require a lot of compute | Ray Train provides a distributed training framework that scales training to multiple GPUs |\n",
    "|Minimize overhead of setting up distributed training| You must manage the underlying infrastructure | Ray Train handles the underlying infrastructure through Ray's autoscaling |\n",
    "|Achieve observability| You need to connect to different nodes and GPUs to find the root cause of failures, fetch logs, traces, etc | Ray Train provides observability through Ray's dashboard, metrics, and traces that let you monitor the training job |\n",
    "|Ensure reliable training| Training jobs can fail due to hardware failures, network issues, or other unexpected events | Ray Train provides fault tolerance through checkpointing, automatic retries, and the ability to resume training from the last checkpoint |\n",
    "|Avoid significant code rewrite| You might need to fully rewrite your training loop to support distributed training | Ray Train provides a suite of integrations with the PyTorch ecosystem, Tree-based methods (XGB, LGBM), and more to minimize the amount of code changes needed |"

    "\n",
    "The preceding diagram shows the **lifecycle of a single training step** in PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP) when orchestrated by Ray Train:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Replication**  \n",
    "   Ray Train initializes the model on GPU rank 0 and broadcasts it to all other workers so that each has an identical copy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sharded Data Loading**  \n",
    "   Ray Train automatically splits the dataset into **non-overlapping shards**. Each worker processes only its shard, ensuring efficient parallelism without duplicate samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forward & Backward Passes**  \n",
    "   Each worker runs a forward pass and computes gradients locally during the backward pass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradient Synchronization**  \n",
    "   An AllReduce step aggregates gradients across workers, ensuring that model updates stay consistent across all GPUs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Weight Updates**  \n",
    "   Once Ray Train synchronizes gradients, each worker applies the update, keeping model replicas in sync.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Checkpointing & Metrics**  \n",
    "   By convention, only the **rank 0 worker** saves checkpoints and logs metrics to persistent storage. This avoids duplication while preserving progress and results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Ray Train, you don't need to manage process groups or samplers manually—utilities like `prepare_model()` and `prepare_data_loader()` wrap these details so your code works out of the box in a distributed setting."

    "- **Larger models**: Integrate **DeepSpeed** or parameter-efficient fine-tuning templates.  \n",
