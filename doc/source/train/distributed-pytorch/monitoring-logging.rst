Monitoring and Logging
======================

Ray AIR provides an API for reporting intermediate
results and checkpoints from the training function (run on distributed workers) up to the
``Trainer`` (where your python script is executed) by calling ``train.report(metrics)``.
The results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to
be logged and displayed.

.. warning::

    Only the results from rank 0 worker will be used. However, in order to ensure
    consistency, ``train.report()`` has to be called on each worker. If you
    want to aggregate results from multiple workers, see :ref:`train-aggregating-results`.

The primary use-case for reporting is for metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.) at
the end of each training epoch.

.. code-block:: python

    from ray import train

    def train_func():
        ...
        for i in range(num_epochs):
            result = model.train(...)
            train.report({"result": result})

The session concept exists on several levels: The execution layer (called `Tune Session`) and the Data Parallel training layer
(called `Train Session`).
The following figure shows how these two sessions look like in a Data Parallel training scenario.

How to obtain and aggregate results from different workers?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In real applications, you may want to calculate optimization metrics besides accuracy and loss: recall, precision, Fbeta, etc.
You may also want to collect metrics from multiple workers. While Ray Train currently only reports metrics from the rank 0
worker, you can use third-party libraries or distributed primitives of your machine learning framework to report
metrics from multiple workers.

    .. tab-item:: Native PyTorch

        Ray Train natively supports `TorchMetrics <https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which provides a collection of machine learning metrics for distributed, scalable PyTorch models.

        Here is an example of reporting both the aggregated R2 score and mean train and validation loss from all workers.
