    "In this example, we set up a Ray cluster on AWS with the following settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  | num | instance type | GPU per node | GPU Memory | CPU Memory |\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|Head node|1|g5.16xlarge|1 x A10G | 24 GB | 256 GB|\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "In this example, we used 16 A10G GPUs for model training and tuned the DeepSpeed configurations for this setup. If you have a different cluster setup or GPUs with lower memory capacities, you may need to modify the DeepSpeed configurations and batch size to fit the model into the GPUs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "We selected a GPU instance with additional CPU memory for the head node to demonstrate single-node offline inference. If you are training only, you can still opt for the g5.4xlarge instance for the head node.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since the checkpoint size for this 13B parameter model can be large (~140GB), we choose to store the checkpoints in AWS S3. Thanks to the newly introduced distributed checkpointing feature in Ray 2.5, each worker can upload its own shards individually to the S3 bucket, greatly reducing the latency and network traffic of checkpoint syncing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Storage\n",
    "To demonstrate offline inference, we need to download and consolidate the model checkpoint onto the head node. This action requires around 200GB disk storage. Therefore, we mounted the NVMe SSD provided by g5 instances at `/dev/nvme1n1` to `/mnt/local_storage`, and we will save the checkpoints in this folder.\n",
