Ray Train FAQ
=============

How fast is Ray Train compared to PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.?
------------------------------------------------------------

At its core, training speed should be the same - while Ray Train launches distributed training workers via Ray Actors,
communication during training (e.g. gradient synchronization) is handled by the backend training framework itself.

For example, when running Ray Train with the ``TorchTrainer``,
distributed training communication is done with Torch's ``DistributedDataParallel``.

Take a look at the :ref:`Pytorch <pytorch-training-parity>` and :ref:`Tensorflow <tf-training-parity>` benchmarks to check performance parity.

How do I set training resources in Ray Train?
---------------------------------------------

By default, each worker will reserve 1 CPU resource, and an additional 1 GPU resource if ``use_gpu=True``.

To override these resource requests or request additional custom resources,
you can initialize the ``Trainer`` with ``resources_per_worker`` specified in ``scaling_config``.

.. note::
   Some GPU utility functions (e.g. :func:`ray.train.torch.get_device`, :func:`ray.train.torch.prepare_model`)
   currently assume each worker is allocated exactly 1 GPU. The partial GPU and multi GPU use-cases
   can still be run with Ray Train today without these functions.

My multi-node PyTorch GPU training is hanging or giving me obscure NCCL errors. What do I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on a multi-node GPU training setup and training is hanging, or you get errors like
`RuntimeError: NCCL error in: /pytorch/torch/lib/c10d/ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:911, unhandled system error`
it could be that there is some networking misconfiguration in your cluster.

To resolve these issues, you can do the following:

1. First run the `ifconfig` command to get the supported network interfaces for your machine. You can install `ifconfig` via `sudo apt install net-tools`.
   You should get an output like so:

2. Choose the network interface that corresponds to the private IP address of your node. In most cases, this will be either
   `ens3` or `ens5`.

3. Set this as the value for the `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` environment variable. You must do this via Ray runtime environments so that it
   gets propagated to all training workers.

.. FIXME: This snippet fails ~10% of runs. See
   https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/36399.

.. testcode::
    :skipif: True

    import ray

    # Add this at the top of your Ray application.
    runtime_env = {"env_vars": {"NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME": "ens5"}}
    ray.init(runtime_env=runtime_env, ignore_reinit_error=True)
