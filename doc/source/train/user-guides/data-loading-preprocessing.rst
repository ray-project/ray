Data Loading and Preprocessing
==============================

Ray Train integrates with :ref:`Ray Data <data>` to offer an efficient, streaming solution for loading and preprocessing large datasets. 
We recommend using Ray Data for its ability to performantly support large-scale distributed training workloads - for advantages and comparisons to alternatives, see :ref:`Ray Data Overview <data_overview>`.

In this guide, we will cover how to incorporate Ray Data into your Ray Train script, and different ways to customize your data ingestion pipeline.

.. TODO: Replace this image with a better one.

Quickstart
----------
Install Ray Data and Ray Train:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U "ray[data,train]"

Data ingestion can be set up with four basic steps:

1. Create a Ray Dataset.
2. Preprocess your Ray Dataset.
3. Input the preprocessed Dataset into the Ray Train Trainer.
4. Consume the Ray Dataset in your training function.

.. _train-datasets-load:

Loading data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ray Datasets can be created from many different data sources and formats. For more details, see :ref:`Loading Data <loading_data>`.

.. _train-datasets-preprocess:

Preprocessing data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ray Data support a wide range of preprocessing operations that can be used to transform your data prior to training.

- For general preprocessing, see :ref:`Transforming Data <transforming_data>`.
- For tabular data, see :ref:`Preprocessing Structured Data <preprocessing_structured_data>`.
- For PyTorch tensors, see :ref:`Transformations with torch tensors <transform_pytorch>`.
- For optimizing expensive preprocessing operations, see :ref:`Caching the preprocessed dataset <dataset_cache_performance>`.

.. _train-datasets-input:

Inputting and splitting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your preprocessed datasets can be passed into a Ray Train Trainer (e.g. :class:`~ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer`) through the ``datasets`` argument.

The datasets passed into the Trainer's ``datasets`` can be accessed inside of the ``train_loop_per_worker`` run on each distributed training worker by calling :meth:`ray.train.get_dataset_shard`. 

All datasets are split (i.e. sharded) across the training workers by default. :meth:`~ray.train.get_dataset_shard` will return ``1/n`` of the dataset, where ``n`` is the number of training workers.

.. note::

    Please be aware that as the evaluation dataset is split, users have to aggregate the evaluation results across workers. 
    You might consider using `TorchMetrics <https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (:ref:`example <deepspeed_example>`) or 
    utilities available in other frameworks that you can explore.

This behavior can be overwritten by passing in the ``dataset_config`` argument. For more information on configuring splitting logic, see :ref:`Splitting datasets <train-datasets-split>`.

.. _train-datasets-consume:

Consuming data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside the ``train_loop_per_worker``, each worker can access its shard of the dataset via :meth:`ray.train.get_dataset_shard`.

This data can be consumed in a variety of ways:

- To create a generic Iterable of batches, you can call :meth:`~ray.data.DataIterator.iter_batches`.
- To create a replacement for a PyTorch DataLoader, you can call :meth:`~ray.data.DataIterator.iter_torch_batches`.

For more details on how to iterate over your data, see :ref:`Iterating over data <iterating-over-data>`.

.. _train-datasets-pytorch:

Starting with PyTorch data
--------------------------

Some frameworks provide their own dataset and data loading utilities. For example:

- **PyTorch:** `Dataset & DataLoader <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html>`_
- **Hugging Face:** `Dataset <https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index>`_
- **PyTorch Lightning:** `LightningDataModule <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html>`_

These utilities can still be used directly with Ray Train. In particular, you may want to do this if you already have your data ingestion pipeline set up.
However, for more performant large-scale data ingestion we do recommend migrating to Ray Data.

At a high level, you can compare these concepts as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - PyTorch API
     - HuggingFace API
     - Ray Data API
   * - `torch.utils.data.Dataset <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset>`_
     - `datasets.Dataset <https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset>`_
     - :class:`ray.data.Dataset`
   * - `torch.utils.data.DataLoader <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader>`_
     - n/a
     - :meth:`ray.data.Dataset.iter_torch_batches`


For more details, see the following sections for each framework.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader

        **Option 1 (with Ray Data):** Convert your PyTorch Dataset to a Ray Dataset and pass it into the Trainer via  ``datasets`` argument.
        Inside your ``train_loop_per_worker``, you can access the dataset via :meth:`ray.train.get_dataset_shard`. 
        You can convert this to replace the PyTorch DataLoader via :meth:`ray.data.DataIterator.iter_torch_batches`.
         
        For more details, see the :ref:`Migrating from PyTorch Datasets and DataLoaders <migrate_pytorch>`.

        **Option 2 (without Ray Data):** Instantiate the Torch Dataset and DataLoader directly in the ``train_loop_per_worker``.
        You can use the :meth:`ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader` utility to set up the DataLoader for distributed training.
    
    .. tab:: LightningDataModule

        The ``LightningDataModule`` is created with PyTorch ``Dataset``\s and ``DataLoader``\s. You can apply the same logic here.

    .. tab:: Hugging Face Dataset

        **Option 1 (with Ray Data):** Convert your Hugging Face Dataset to a Ray Dataset and pass it into the Trainer via the ``datasets`` argument.
        Inside your ``train_loop_per_worker``, you can access the dataset via :meth:`ray.train.get_dataset_shard`. 

        For instructions, see :ref:`Ray Data for Hugging Face <loading_datasets_from_ml_libraries>`.

        **Option 2 (without Ray Data):** Instantiate the Hugging Face Dataset directly in the ``train_loop_per_worker``.

    .. tip:: 

        When using Torch or Hugging Face Datasets directly without Ray Data, make sure to instantiate your Dataset *inside* the ``train_loop_per_worker``. 
        Instatiating the Dataset outside of the ``train_loop_per_worker`` and passing it in via global scope
        can cause errors due to the Dataset not being serializable.

.. _train-datasets-split:

Splitting datasets
------------------
By default, Ray Train splits all datasets across workers using :meth:`Dataset.streaming_split <ray.data.Dataset.streaming_split>`. Each worker sees a disjoint subset of the data, instead of iterating over the entire dataset. Unless randomly shuffled, the same splits are used for each iteration of the dataset. 

If want to customize which datasets are split, pass in a :class:`DataConfig <ray.train.DataConfig>` to the Trainer constructor. 

For example, to split only the training dataset, do the following:

.. testcode::

    import ray
    from ray import train
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer

    ds = ray.data.read_text(
        "s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt"
    )
    train_ds, val_ds = ds.train_test_split(0.3)

    def train_loop_per_worker():
        # Get the sharded training dataset
        train_ds = train.get_dataset_shard("train")
        for _ in range(2):
            for batch in train_ds.iter_batches(batch_size=128):
                print("Do some training on batch", batch)
        
        # Get the unsharded full validation dataset
        val_ds = train.get_dataset_shard("val")
        for _ in range(2):
            for batch in val_ds.iter_batches(batch_size=128):
                print("Do some evaluation on batch", batch)

    my_trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_loop_per_worker,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=2),
        datasets={"train": train_ds, "val": val_ds},
        dataset_config=ray.train.DataConfig(
            datasets_to_split=["train"],
        ),
    )
    my_trainer.fit()


Full customization (advanced)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For use cases not covered by the default config class, you can also fully customize exactly how your input datasets are split. Define a custom :class:`DataConfig <ray.train.DataConfig>` class (DeveloperAPI). The :class:`DataConfig <ray.train.DataConfig>` class is responsible for that shared setup and splitting of data across nodes.

.. testcode::

    # Note that this example class is doing the same thing as the basic DataConfig
    # implementation included with Ray Train.
    from typing import Optional, Dict, List

    import ray
    from ray import train
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer
    from ray.train import DataConfig, ScalingConfig
    from ray.data import Dataset, DataIterator, NodeIdStr
    from ray.actor import ActorHandle

    ds = ray.data.read_text(
        "s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt"
    )

    def train_loop_per_worker():
        # Get an iterator to the dataset we passed in below.
        it = train.get_dataset_shard("train")
        for _ in range(2):
            for batch in it.iter_batches(batch_size=128):
                print("Do some training on batch", batch)


    class MyCustomDataConfig(DataConfig):
        def configure(
            self,
            datasets: Dict[str, Dataset],
            world_size: int,
            worker_handles: Optional[List[ActorHandle]],
            worker_node_ids: Optional[List[NodeIdStr]],
            **kwargs,
        ) -> List[Dict[str, DataIterator]]:
            assert len(datasets) == 1, "This example only handles the simple case"

            # Configure Ray Data for ingest.
            ctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()
            ctx.execution_options = DataConfig.default_ingest_options()

            # Split the stream into shards.
            iterator_shards = datasets["train"].streaming_split(
                world_size, equal=True, locality_hints=worker_node_ids
            )

            # Return the assigned iterators for each worker.
            return [{"train": it} for it in iterator_shards]


    my_trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_loop_per_worker,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=2),
        datasets={"train": ds},
        dataset_config=MyCustomDataConfig(),
    )
    my_trainer.fit()


The subclass must be serializable, since Ray Train copies it from the driver script to the driving actor of the Trainer. Ray Train calls its :meth:`configure <ray.train.DataConfig.configure>` method on the main actor of the Trainer group to create the data iterators for each worker.

In general, you can use :class:`DataConfig <ray.train.DataConfig>` for any shared setup that has to occur ahead of time before the workers start iterating over data. The setup runs at the start of each Trainer run.


Random shuffling
----------------
Randomly shuffling data for each epoch can be important for model quality depending on what model you are training.

Ray Data has two approaches to random shuffling:

1. Shuffling data blocks and local shuffling on each training worker. This requires less communication at the cost of less randomness (i.e. rows that appear in the same data block are more likely to appear near each other in the iteration order).
2. Full global shuffle, which is more expensive. This will fully decorrelate row iteration order from the original dataset order, at the cost of significantly more computation, I/O, and communication.

For most cases, option 1 suffices. 

First, randomize each :ref:`block <dataset_concept>` of your dataset via :meth:`randomize_block_order <ray.data.Dataset.randomize_block_order>`. Then, when iterating over your dataset during training, enable local shuffling by specifying a ``local_shuffle_buffer_size`` to :meth:`iter_batches <ray.data.DataIterator.iter_batches>` or :meth:`iter_torch_batches <ray.data.DataIterator.iter_torch_batches>`.

.. testcode::
    import ray
    from ray import train
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer

    ds = ray.data.read_text(
        "s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt"
    )

    # Randomize the blocks of this dataset.
    ds = ds.randomize_block_order()

    def train_loop_per_worker():
        # Get an iterator to the dataset we passed in below.
        it = train.get_dataset_shard("train")
        for _ in range(2):
            # Use a shuffle buffer size of 10k rows.
            for batch in it.iter_batches(
                local_shuffle_buffer_size=10000, batch_size=128):
                print("Do some training on batch", batch)

    my_trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_loop_per_worker,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=2),
        datasets={"train": ds},
    )
    my_trainer.fit()


If your model is sensitive to shuffle quality, call :meth:`Dataset.random_shuffle <ray.data.Dataset.random_shuffle>` to perform a global shuffle.

.. testcode::

    import ray

    ds = ray.data.read_text(
        "s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt"
    )

    # Do a global shuffle of all rows in this dataset.
    # The dataset will be shuffled on each iteration, unless `.materialize()`
    # is called after the `.random_shuffle()`
    ds = ds.random_shuffle()

For more information on how to optimize shuffling, and which approach to choose, see the :ref:`Optimize shuffling guide <optimizing_shuffles>`.


Enabling reproducibility
------------------------
When developing or hyperparameter tuning models, reproducibility is important during data ingest so that data ingest does not affect model quality. Follow these three steps to enable reproducibility:

**Step 1:** Enable deterministic execution in Ray Datasets by setting the `preserve_order` flag in the :class:`DataContext <ray.data.context.DataContext>`.

.. testcode::

    import ray

    # Preserve ordering in Ray Datasets for reproducibility.
    ctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()
    ctx.execution_options.preserve_order = True

    ds = ray.data.read_text(
        "s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt"
    )

**Step 2:** Set a seed for any shuffling operations: 

* `seed` argument to :meth:`random_shuffle <ray.data.Dataset.random_shuffle>`
* `seed` argument to :meth:`randomize_block_order <ray.data.Dataset.randomize_block_order>` 
* `local_shuffle_seed` argument to :meth:`iter_batches <ray.data.DataIterator.iter_batches>`

**Step 3:** Follow the best practices for enabling reproducibility for your training framework of choice. For example, see the `Pytorch reproducibility guide <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html>`_.



.. _preprocessing_structured_data:

Preprocessing structured data
-----------------------------

.. note::
    This section is for tabular/structured data. The recommended way for preprocessing unstructured data is to use
    Ray Data operations such as `map_batches`. See the :ref:`Ray Data Working with Pytorch guide <working_with_pytorch>` for more details.

For tabular data, we recommend using Ray Data :ref:`preprocessors <data-preprocessors>`, which implement common data preprocessing operations.
You can use this with Ray Train Trainers by applying them on the dataset before passing the dataset into a Trainer. For example:

.. testcode::

    import numpy as np
    from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

    import ray
    from ray import train
    from ray.train import Checkpoint, ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer
    from ray.data.preprocessors import Concatenator, StandardScaler

    dataset = ray.data.read_csv("s3://anonymous@air-example-data/breast_cancer.csv")

    # Create preprocessors to scale some columns and concatenate the results.
    scaler = StandardScaler(columns=["mean radius", "mean texture"])
    concatenator = Concatenator(exclude=["target"], dtype=np.float32)

    # Compute dataset statistics and get transformed datasets. Note that the
    # fit call is executed immediately, but the transformation is lazy.
    dataset = scaler.fit_transform(dataset)
    dataset = concatenator.fit_transform(dataset)

    def train_loop_per_worker():
        context = train.get_context()
        print(context.get_metadata())  # prints {"preprocessor_pkl": ...}

        # Get an iterator to the dataset we passed in below.
        it = train.get_dataset_shard("train")
        for _ in range(2):
            # Prefetch 10 batches at a time.
            for batch in it.iter_batches(batch_size=128, prefetch_batches=10):
                print("Do some training on batch", batch)

        # Save a checkpoint.
        with TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            train.report(
                {"score": 2.0},
                checkpoint=Checkpoint.from_directory(temp_dir),
            )

    my_trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_loop_per_worker,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=2),
        datasets={"train": dataset},
        metadata={"preprocessor_pkl": scaler.serialize()},
    )

    # Get the fitted preprocessor back from the result metadata.
    metadata = my_trainer.fit().checkpoint.get_metadata()
    print(StandardScaler.deserialize(metadata["preprocessor_pkl"]))


In this example, we persist the fitted preprocessor using the ``Trainer(metadata={...})`` constructor argument. This arg specifies a dict that will available from ``TrainContext.get_metadata()`` and ``checkpoint.get_metadata()`` for checkpoints saved from the Trainer. This enables recreation of the fitted preprocessor for use for inference.

Performance tips
----------------

Prefetching batches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While iterating over your dataset for training, you can increase ``prefetch_batches`` in :meth:`iter_batches <ray.data.DataIterator.iter_batches>` or :meth:`iter_torch_batches <ray.data.DataIterator.iter_torch_batches>` to further increase performance. While training on the current batch, this launches N background threads to fetch and process the next N batches.

This approach can help if training is bottlenecked on cross-node data transfer or on last-mile preprocessing such as converting batches to tensors or executing ``collate_fn``. However, increasing ``prefetch_batches`` leads to more data that needs to be held in heap memory. By default, ``prefetch_batches`` is set to 1.

For example, the following code prefetches 10 batches at a time for each training worker:

.. testcode::

    import ray
    from ray import train
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer

    ds = ray.data.read_text(
        "s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt"
    )

    def train_loop_per_worker():
        # Get an iterator to the dataset we passed in below.
        it = train.get_dataset_shard("train")
        for _ in range(2):
            # Prefetch 10 batches at a time.
            for batch in it.iter_batches(batch_size=128, prefetch_batches=10):
                print("Do some training on batch", batch)

    my_trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_loop_per_worker,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=2),
        datasets={"train": ds},
    )
    my_trainer.fit()


.. _dataset_cache_performance:

Caching the preprocessed dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're training on GPUs and have an expensive CPU preprocessing operation, this approach may bottleneck training throughput.

If your preprocessed Dataset is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory (by default this is 30% of total cluster RAM), *materialize* the preprocessed dataset in Ray's built-in object store, by calling :meth:`materialize() <ray.data.Dataset.materialize>` on the preprocessed dataset. This method tells Ray Data to compute the entire preprocessed and pin it in the Ray object store memory. As a result, when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run. However, if the preprocessed data is too large to fit into Ray object store memory, this approach will greatly decreases performance as data needs to be spilled to and read back from disk.

Transformations that you want run per-epoch, such as randomization, should go after the materialize call.

.. testcode::

    from typing import Dict
    import numpy as np
    import ray

    # Load the data.
    train_ds = ray.data.read_parquet("s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/iris.parquet")

    # Define a preprocessing function.
    def normalize_length(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:
        new_col = batch["sepal.length"] / np.max(batch["sepal.length"])
        batch["normalized.sepal.length"] = new_col
        del batch["sepal.length"]
        return batch

    # Preprocess the data. Transformations that are made before the materialize call
    # below are only run once.
    train_ds = train_ds.map_batches(normalize_length)

    # Materialize the dataset in object store memory.
    # Only do this if train_ds is small enough to fit in object store memory.
    train_ds = train_ds.materialize()

    # Dummy augmentation transform.
    def augment_data(batch):
        return batch

    # Add per-epoch preprocessing. Transformations that you want to run per-epoch, such
    # as data augmentation or randomization, should go after the materialize call.
    train_ds = train_ds.map_batches(augment_data)

    # Pass train_ds to the Trainer


Adding CPU-only nodes to your cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are bottlenecked on expensive CPU preprocessing and the preprocessed Dataset is too large to fit in object store memory, then materializing the dataset doesn't work. In this case, since Ray supports heterogeneous clusters, you can add more CPU-only nodes to your cluster.

For cases where you're bottlenecked by object store memory, adding more CPU-only nodes to your cluster increases total cluster object store memory, allowing more data to be buffered in between preprocessing and training stages.

For cases where you're bottlenecked by preprocessing compute time, adding more CPU-only nodes adds more CPU cores to your cluster, further parallelizing preprocessing. If your preprocessing is still not fast enough to saturate GPUs, then add enough CPU-only nodes to :ref:`cache the preprocessed dataset <dataset_cache_performance>`.
