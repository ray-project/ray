.. _train_scaling_config:

Configuring Scale and Resources
===============================
Increasing the scale of a Ray Train training run is simple and can be done in a few lines of code.
The main interface for this is the :class:`~ray.train.ScalingConfig`,
which configures the number of workers and the resources they should use.

In this guide, a *worker* refers to a Ray Train distributed training worker,
which is a :ref:`Ray Actor <actor-key-concept>` that runs your training function.

Increasing the number of workers
--------------------------------
The main interface to control parallelism in your training code is to set the
number of workers. This can be done by passing the ``num_workers`` attribute to
the :class:`~ray.train.ScalingConfig`:

.. testcode::

    from ray.train import ScalingConfig

    scaling_config = ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=8
    )


Using GPUs
----------
To use GPUs, pass ``use_gpu=True`` to the :class:`~ray.train.ScalingConfig`.
This will request one GPU per training worker. In the example below, training will
run on 8 GPUs (8 workers, each using one GPU).

.. testcode::

    from ray.train import ScalingConfig

    scaling_config = ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=8,
        use_gpu=True
    )


Using GPUs in the training function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When ``use_gpu=True`` is set, Ray Train will automatically set up environment variables
in your training function so that the GPUs can be detected and used
(e.g. ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``).

You can get the associated devices with :meth:`ray.train.torch.get_device`.

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer, get_device


    def train_func():
        assert torch.cuda.is_available()

        device = get_device()
        assert device == torch.device("cuda:0")

    trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_func,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(
            num_workers=1,
            use_gpu=True
        )
    )
    trainer.fit()

Assigning multiple GPUs to a worker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes you might want to allocate multiple GPUs for a worker. For example,
you can specify `resources_per_worker={"GPU": 2}` in the `ScalingConfig` if you want to
assign 2 GPUs for each worker.

You can get a list of associated devices with :meth:`ray.train.torch.get_devices`.

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer, get_device, get_devices


    def train_func():
        assert torch.cuda.is_available()

        device = get_device()
        devices = get_devices()
        assert device == torch.device("cuda:0")
        assert devices == [torch.device("cuda:0"), torch.device("cuda:1")]

    trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_func,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(
            num_workers=1,
            use_gpu=True,
            resources_per_worker={"GPU": 2}
        )
    )
    trainer.fit()


Setting the GPU type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ray Train allows you to specify the accelerator type for each worker.
This is useful if you want to use a specific accelerator type for model training.
In a heterogeneous Ray cluster, this means that your training workers will be forced to run on the specified GPU type,
rather than on any arbitrary GPU node. You can get a list of supported `accelerator_type` from
:ref:`the available accelerator types <accelerator_types>`.

For example, you can specify `accelerator_type="A100"` in the :class:`~ray.train.ScalingConfig` if you want to
assign each worker a NVIDIA A100 GPU.

.. tip::
    Ensure that your cluster has instances with the specified accelerator type
    or is able to autoscale to fulfill the request.

.. testcode::

    ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=1,
        use_gpu=True,
        accelerator_type="A100"
    )


(PyTorch) Setting the communication backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyTorch Distributed supports multiple `backends <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#backends>`__
for communicating tensors across workers. By default Ray Train will use NCCL when ``use_gpu=True`` and Gloo otherwise.

If you explicitly want to override this setting, you can configure a :class:`~ray.train.torch.TorchConfig`
and pass it into the :class:`~ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer`.

.. testcode::
    :hide:

    num_training_workers = 1

.. testcode::

    from ray.train.torch import TorchConfig, TorchTrainer

    trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_func,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(
            num_workers=num_training_workers,
            use_gpu=True, # Defaults to NCCL
        ),
        torch_config=TorchConfig(backend="gloo"),
    )

(NCCL) Setting the communication network interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using NCCL for distributed training, you can configure the network interface cards
that are used for communicating between GPUs by setting the
`NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html#nccl-socket-ifname>`__
environment variable.

To ensure that the environment variable is set for all training workers, you can pass it
in a :ref:`Ray runtime environment <runtime-environments>`:

.. testcode::
    :skipif: True

    import ray

    runtime_env = {"env_vars": {"NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME": "ens5"}}
    ray.init(runtime_env=runtime_env)

    trainer = TorchTrainer(...)

.. _using-other-accelerators:

Using other accelerators
------------------------

Using HPUs
~~~~~~~~~~

To use HPUs, specify the HPU resources using the ``resources_per_worker`` parameter and pass it to the :class:`~ray.train.ScalingConfig`.
In the example below, training will run on 8 HPUs (8 workers, each using one HPU).

.. testcode::

    from ray.train import ScalingConfig

    scaling_config = ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=8,
        resources_per_worker={"HPU": 1}
    )

Using HPUs in the training function
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After you set the ``resources_per_worker`` attribute to specify the HPU resources for each worker, Ray Train can set up environment variables in your training function so that the HPUs can be detected and used.

You can get the associated devices with :meth:`ray.train.torch.get_device`.

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from ray.train import ScalingConfig
    from ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer, get_device


    def train_func():
        device = get_device()
        assert device == torch.device("hpu")

    trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_func,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(
            num_workers=1,
            resources_per_worker={"HPU": 1}
        )
    )
    trainer.fit()

(PyTorch) Setting the communication backend
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PyTorch supports a few communication backends such as MPI, Gloo and NCCL natively. Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerator support for distributed communication can be enabled using Habana Collective Communication Library (HCCL) backend. When using HPU resources, You can set HCCL as the communication backend by configuring a :class:`~ray.train.torch.TorchConfig` and passing it into the :class:`~ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer` as follows.

.. testcode::
    :hide:

    num_training_workers = 1

.. testcode::

    from ray.train.torch import TorchConfig, TorchTrainer

    trainer = TorchTrainer(
        train_func,
        scaling_config=ScalingConfig(
            num_workers=num_training_workers,
            resources_per_worker={"CPU": 1, "HPU": 1},
        ),
        torch_config=TorchConfig(backend="hccl"),
    )

Setting the resources per worker
--------------------------------
If you want to allocate more than one CPU or GPU per training worker, or if you
defined :ref:`custom cluster resources <cluster-resources>`, set
the ``resources_per_worker`` attribute:

.. testcode::

    from ray.train import ScalingConfig

    scaling_config = ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=8,
        resources_per_worker={
            "CPU": 4,
            "GPU": 2,
        },
        use_gpu=True,
    )


.. note::
    If you specify GPUs in ``resources_per_worker``, you also need to set
    ``use_gpu=True``.

You can also instruct Ray Train to use fractional GPUs. In that case, multiple workers
will be assigned the same CUDA device.

.. testcode::

    from ray.train import ScalingConfig

    scaling_config = ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=8,
        resources_per_worker={
            "CPU": 4,
            "GPU": 0.5,
        },
        use_gpu=True,
    )



(Deprecated) Trainer resources
------------------------------

.. important::
    This API is deprecated. See `this migration guide <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/49454>`_ for more details.


So far we've configured resources for each training worker. Technically, each
training worker is a :ref:`Ray Actor <actor-guide>`. Ray Train also schedules
an actor for the trainer object when you call ``trainer.fit()``.

This object often only manages lightweight communication between the training workers.
Per default, a trainer uses 1 CPU. If you have a cluster with 8 CPUs and want
to start 4 training workers a 2 CPUs, this will not work, as the total number
of required CPUs will be 9 (4 * 2 + 1). In that case, you can specify the trainer
resources to use 0 CPUs:

.. testcode::

    from ray.train import ScalingConfig

    scaling_config = ScalingConfig(
        num_workers=4,
        resources_per_worker={
            "CPU": 2,
        },
        trainer_resources={
            "CPU": 0,
        }
    )
