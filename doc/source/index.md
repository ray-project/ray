**Scale machine learning workloads with**\
**<img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">AIR**
^^^
Ray AI Runtime (AIR) is an open-source toolkit for building ML applications. 
It provides libraries for distributed 
[data processing](data/dataset.rst), 
[model training](train/train.rst), 
[tuning](tune/index.rst), 
[reinforcement learning](rllib/index.rst), 
[model serving](serve/index.rst), 
and [more](ray-more-libs/index.rst).

**Build distributed applications with**\
**<img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">Core**
^^^
Ray Core provides a [simple and flexible API](ray-core/walkthrough.rst) for building and running your distributed applications.
You can often [parallelize](ray-core/walkthrough.rst) single machine code with little to zero code changes.

**Deploy large-scale workloads with**\
**<img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">Clusters**
^^^
With a Ray cluster you can deploy your workloads on [AWS, GCP, Azure](cluster/getting-started) or 
[on premise](cluster/vms/user-guides/launching-clusters/on-premises).
You can also use Ray cluster managers to run Ray on your existing
[Kubernetes](cluster/kubernetes/index),
[YARN](cluster/vms/user-guides/community/yarn),
or [Slurm](cluster/vms/user-guides/community/slurm) clusters.

## What is Ray?

Ray is a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications.
Ray consists of a core distributed runtime and a toolkit of libraries (Ray AIR) for
simplifying ML compute:

&nbsp;

Learn more about [Ray AIR](ray-air/getting-started) and its libraries:
- [Datasets](data/dataset): Distributed Data Preprocessing
- [Train](train/train): Distributed Training
- [Tune](tune/index): Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
- [Serve](serve/index): Scalable and Programmable Serving
- [RLlib](rllib/index): Scalable Reinforcement Learning

Or more about [Ray Core](ray-core/walkthrough) and its key abstractions:
- [Tasks](ray-core/tasks): Stateless functions executed in the cluster.
- [Actors](ray-core/actors): Stateful worker processes created in the cluster.
- [Objects](ray-core/objects): Immutable values accessible across the cluster.

Ray runs on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes, and features a growing
[ecosystem of community integrations](ray-overview/ray-libraries).

## Why Ray?

Today's ML workloads are increasingly compute-intensive. As convenient as they are, single-node development environments such as your laptop cannot scale to meet these demands.

Ray is a unified way to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a cluster.

With Ray, you can seamlessly scale the same code from a laptop to a cluster. Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.

## How to get involved?

Ray is more than a framework for distributed applications but also an active community of developers, researchers, and folks that love machine learning.
Here's a list of tips for getting involved with the Ray community:
