**Build distributed applications with <img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">Core**
^^^
Ray Core provides a [simple and flexible API](ray-core/walkthrough.rst) for building and running your distributed applications.
You can often parallelize single machine code with little to zero code changes.

For instance, with Ray Core you can easily parallelize your functions using 
[Ray Tasks](ray-core/walkthrough.rst#remote-functions-tasks) or your classes using 
[Ray Actors](ray-core/actors.rst).

**Run machine learning workflows with <img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">ML**
^^^
With Ray ML you can run tasks like [distributed data loading and compute](data/dataset.rst),
[distributed deep learning](train/train.rst),
[scalable hyperparameter tuning](tune/index.rst),
or [industry-grade reinforcement learning](rllib/index.rst).

For production, Ray ML offers [scalable model serving](serve/index.rst) 
and [fast, durable application flows](workflows/concepts.rst).

**Deploy large-scale workloads with <img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">Cluster**
^^^
With Ray Cluster you can deploy your workloads on [AWS, GCP, Azure](cluster/quickstart) or 
[on premise](cluster/cloud.html#cluster-private-setup). The [Ray auto-scaler](cluster/sdk)
 and Ray runtime handle the scheduling, distributing, and fault-tolerance needs of your application.

You can also use [Ray Cluster Managers](cluster/deploy) to run Ray on your existing
[Kubernetes](cluster/kubernetes),
[YARN](cluster/yarn),
or [Slurm](cluster/slurm) clusters.

## What is Ray?

Ray is an open-source project developed at UC Berkeley RISE Lab.
As a general-purpose and universal distributed compute framework, you can flexibly run any compute-intensive Python workload ‚Äî from distributed training or hyperparameter tuning to deep reinforcement learning and production model serving.
To help you, Ray Core provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.
And Ray's native libraries and tools enable you to run complex ML applications with Ray.
You can deploy these applications on any of the major cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, and Azure, or run them on your own servers.
Ray also has a growing [ecosystem of community integrations](ray-overview/ray-libraries), including [Dask](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/dask-on-ray.html), [MARS](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/mars-on-ray.html), [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin), [Horovod](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ray_include.html), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer.hyperparameter_search), [Scikit-learn](ray-more-libs/joblib), [and others](ray-more-libs/index).
The following figure gives you an overview of the Ray ecosystem.
