**Run machine learning workflows with**\
**<img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">ML**
^^^
Ray ML is a toolkit for distributed machine learning. 
It provides libraries for distributed 
[data processing](data/dataset.rst), 
[model training](train/train.rst), 
[tuning](tune/index.rst), 
[reinforcement learning](rllib/index.rst), 
[model serving](serve/index.rst), 
and [more](workflows/concepts.rst).

**Build distributed applications with**\
**<img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">Core**
^^^
Ray Core provides a [simple and flexible API](ray-core/walkthrough.rst) for building and running your distributed applications.
You can often [parallelize](ray-core/walkthrough.rst) single machine code with little to zero code changes.

**Deploy large-scale workloads with**\
**<img src="ray-overview/images/ray_svg_logo.svg" alt="ray" width="50px">Clusters**
^^^
With a Ray cluster you can deploy your workloads on [AWS, GCP, Azure](cluster/quickstart) or 
[on premise](cluster/cloud.html#cluster-private-setup).
You can also use [Ray Cluster Managers](cluster/deploy) to run Ray on your existing
[Kubernetes](cluster/kubernetes),
[YARN](cluster/yarn),
or [Slurm](cluster/slurm) clusters.

## What is Ray?

Ray is an open-source project developed at UC Berkeley RISE Lab.
As a general-purpose and universal distributed compute framework, you can flexibly run any compute-intensive Python workload â€” from distributed training or hyperparameter tuning to deep reinforcement learning and production model serving.

- Ray Core provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.
- Ray's native libraries and tools enable you to run complex ML applications with Ray.
- You can deploy these applications on any of the major cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, and Azure, or run them on your own servers.
- Ray also has a growing [ecosystem of community integrations](ray-overview/ray-libraries), including [Dask](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/dask-on-ray.html), [MARS](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/mars-on-ray.html), [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin), [Horovod](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ray_include.html), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Trainer.hyperparameter_search), [Scikit-learn](ray-more-libs/joblib), [and others](ray-more-libs/index).
The following figure gives you an overview of the Ray ecosystem.
