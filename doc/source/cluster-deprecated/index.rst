Ray Clusters Overview
=====================

What is a Ray cluster?
----------------------

One of Ray's strengths is the ability to leverage multiple machines for
distributed execution. Ray can, of course, be run on a single machine (and is
done so often), but the real power is using Ray on a cluster of machines.

Ray can automatically interact with the cloud provider to request or release
instances. You can specify :ref:`a configuration <cluster-config>` to launch
clusters on :ref:`AWS, GCP, Azure (community-maintained), Aliyun (community-maintained), on-premise, or even on
your custom node provider <cluster-cloud>`. Ray can also be run on :ref:`Kubernetes <kuberay-index>` infrastructure.
Your cluster can have a fixed size
or :ref:`automatically scale up and down<cluster-autoscaler>` depending on the
demands of your application.
