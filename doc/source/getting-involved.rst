Getting Involved / Contributing
===============================

Ray is more than a framework for distributed applications but also an active community of developers,
researchers, and folks that love machine learning.

.. tip:: Ask questions on `our forum <https://discuss.ray.io/>`_! The
  community is extremely active in helping people succeed in building their
  Ray applications.

You can join (and Star!) us on `on GitHub`_.

.. _`on GitHub`: https://github.com/ray-project/ray

Contributing to Ray
-------------------

We welcome (and encourage!) all forms of contributions to Ray, including and not limited to:

- Code reviewing of patches and PRs.
- Pushing patches.
- Documentation and examples.
- Community participation in forums and issues.
- Code readability and code comments to improve readability.
- Test cases to make the codebase more robust.
- Tutorials, blog posts, talks that promote the project.


What can I work on?
-------------------

We use Github to track issues, feature requests, and bugs. Take a look at the
ones labeled `"good first issue" <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`__ and `"help wanted" <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`__ for a place to start.

Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

To edit the Ray source code, you'll want to checkout the repository and also build Ray from source. Follow :ref:`these instructions for building <building-ray>` a local copy of Ray to easily make changes.


Submitting and Merging a Contribution
-------------------------------------

There are a couple steps to merge a contribution.

1. First rebase your development branch on the most recent version of master.

   .. code:: bash

     git remote add upstream https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git
     git fetch upstream
     git rebase upstream/master

2. Make sure all existing tests `pass <getting-involved.html#testing>`__.
3. If introducing a new feature or patching a bug, be sure to add new test cases
   in the relevant file in `ray/python/ray/tests/`.
4. Document the code. Public functions need to be documented, and remember to provide an usage
   example if applicable.
5. Request code reviews from other contributors and address their comments. One fast way to get reviews is
   to help review others' code so that they return the favor. You should aim to improve the code as much as
   possible before the review. We highly value patches that can get in without extensive reviews.
6. Reviewers will merge and approve the pull request; be sure to ping them if
   the pull request is getting stale.

Testing
-------

Even though we have hooks to run unit tests automatically for each pull request,
we recommend you to run unit tests locally beforehand to reduce reviewersâ€™
burden and speedup review process.


.. code-block:: shell

    pytest ray/python/ray/tests/

Documentation should be documented in `Google style <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`__ format.


Testing for Python development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose that one of the tests in a file of tests, e.g.,
``python/ray/tests/test_basic.py``, is failing. You can run just that
test file locally as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

 python -m pytest -v python/ray/tests/test_basic.py

However, this will run all of the tests in the file, which can take some
time. To run a specific test that is failing, you can do the following
instead:

.. code-block:: shell

    pytest test_file.py -v -k [test substring]

When running tests, usually only the first test failure matters. A single
test failure often triggers the failure of subsequent tests in the same
file.

.. code-block:: shell

    # Stop after first failure.
    pytest test_file.py -x

Testing for C++ development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile and run all C++ tests, you can run:

.. code-block:: shell

 bazel test $(bazel query 'kind(cc_test, ...)')

Alternatively, you can also run one specific C++ test. You can use:

.. code-block:: shell

 bazel test $(bazel query 'kind(cc_test, ...)') --test_filter=ClientConnectionTest --test_output=streamed


Lint and Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Python 3.7 is recommended. You will run into flake8 `issues <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/11588>`_ with Python 3.8.

We also have tests for code formatting and linting that need to pass before merge.
Install ``yapf==0.23, flake8, flake8-quotes``.

* `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_ version ``0.23.0`` (``pip install yapf==0.23.0``)
* `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ version ``3.7.7`` (``pip install flake8==3.7.7``)
* `flake8-quotes <https://github.com/zheller/flake8-quotes>`_ (``pip install flake8-quotes``)
* If developing for C++, you will need `clang-format <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/clang-format.html>`_ version ``7.0.0`` (download this version of Clang from `here <http://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_)


.. note:: On MacOS X, don't use HomeBrew to install ``clang-format``, as the only version available is too new.

You can run the following locally:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./ci/travis/format.sh

An output like the following indicates failure:

.. code-block:: shell

  WARNING: clang-format is not installed!  # This is harmless
  From https://github.com/ray-project/ray
   * branch                master     -> FETCH_HEAD
  python/ray/util/sgd/tf/tf_runner.py:4:1: F401 'numpy as np' imported but unused  # Below is the failure

In addition, there are other formatting checkers for components like the following:

* Python README format:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd python
    python setup.py check --restructuredtext --strict --metadata

* Bazel format:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./ci/travis/bazel-format.sh

Understanding CI test jobs
--------------------------

The Ray project automatically runs continuous integration (CI) tests once a PR
is opened using `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.com/ray-project/ray/>`_ with
multiple CI test jobs.

The `Travis CI`_ test folder contains all integration test scripts and they
invoke other test scripts via ``pytest``, ``bazel``-based test or other bash
scripts. Some of the examples include:

* Raylet integration tests commands:
    * ``bazel test //:core_worker_test``
    * ``src/ray/test/run_object_manager_tests.sh``

* Bazel test command:
    * ``bazel test --build_tests_only //:all``

* Ray serving test commands:
    * ``pytest python/ray/serve/tests``
    * ``python python/ray/serve/examples/echo_full.py``

If a Travis-CI build exception doesn't appear to be related to your change,
please visit `this link <https://ray-travis-tracker.herokuapp.com/>`_ to
check recent tests known to be flaky.

Becoming a Reviewer
-------------------

We identify reviewers from active contributors. Reviewers are individuals who
not only actively contribute to the project and are also willing
to participate in the code review of new contributions.
A pull request to the project has to be reviewed by at least one reviewer in order to be merged.
There is currently no formal process, but active contributors to Ray will be
solicited by current reviewers.
