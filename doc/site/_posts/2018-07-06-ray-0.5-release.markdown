We are pleased to announce the 0.5 release of [Ray][1]. To upgrade to the latest
version, run

```
pip install -U ray
```

## Refactoring

One primary development is a substantial refactoring of the backend, which is
currently off by default, but can be turned on by starting Ray with the
environment variable `RAY_USE_XRAY=1`. This will be turned on soon after more
testing and development and will be on by default in the next release. Some
highlights of the refactor include the following:
- Merging the "local scheduler" and the "plasma manager" into a single "raylet"
  process (consisting of a "node manager" and an "object manager").
- Faster object transfers by using multiple threads to send objects in chunks.
- The introduction of a "lineage cache" to improve latency by removing the
  global control store from the scheduling critical path.
- The removal of the global scheduler (which is replaced by direct node-manager
  to node-manager communication)
- Providing a standardized table-based interface to the Redis-backed global
  control store.
- A preliminary approach for automatically flushing global control store
  metadata to avoid out-of-memory errors for long-running jobs.

Note that the refactoring is currently under development and does not yet
support fault tolerance.
