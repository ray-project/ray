Learning to Play Pong
=====================

In this example, we'll train a **very simple** neural network to play Pong using
the OpenAI Gym.

At a high level, we will use multiple Ray actors to obtain simulation rollouts
and calculate gradient simultaneously. We will then centralize these
gradients and update the neural network. The updated neural network will
then be passed back to each Ray actor for more gradient calculation.

This application is adapted, with minimal modifications, from
Andrej Karpathy's `source code`_ (see the accompanying `blog post`_).

To run the application, first install some dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install gym[atari]

At the moment, on a large machine with 64 physical cores, computing an update
with a batch of size 1 takes about 1 second, a batch of size 10 takes about 2.5
seconds. A batch of size 60 takes about 3 seconds. On a cluster with 11 nodes,
each with 18 physical cores, a batch of size 300 takes about 10 seconds. If the
numbers you see differ from these by much, take a look at the
**Troubleshooting** section at the bottom of this page and consider `submitting
an issue`_.

.. _`source code`: https://gist.github.com/karpathy/a4166c7fe253700972fcbc77e4ea32c5
.. _`blog post`: http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/
.. _`submitting an issue`: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues

**Note** that these times depend on how long the rollouts take, which in turn
depends on how well the policy is doing. For example, a really bad policy will
lose very quickly. As the policy learns, we should expect these numbers to
increase.

# Hyperparameters
# ---------------
#
# Here we'll define a couple of the hyperparameters that are used.

H = 200  # The number of hidden layer neurons.
gamma = 0.99  # The discount factor for reward.
decay_rate = 0.99  # The decay factor for RMSProp leaky sum of grad^2.
D = 80 * 80  # The input dimensionality: 80x80 grid.
learning_rate = 1e-4  # Magnitude of the update.

#############################################################################
# Helper Functions
# ----------------
#
# We first define a few helper functions:
#
# 1. Preprocessing: The ``preprocess`` function will
# preprocess the original 210x160x3 uint8 frame into a one-dimensional 6400
# float vector.
#
# 2. Reward Processing: The ``process_rewards`` function will calculate
# a discounted reward. This formula states that the "value" of a
# sampled action is the weighted sum of all rewards afterwards,
# but later rewards are exponentially less important.
#
# 3. Rollout: The ``rollout`` function plays an entire game of Pong (until
# either the computer or the RL agent loses).
