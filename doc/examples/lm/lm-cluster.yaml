# The minimum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. This number should be >= 0.

# The maximum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. This takes precedence over min_workers.

# The initial number of worker nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. When the cluster is first brought up (or when it is refreshed with a
# subsequent `ray up`) this number of nodes will be started.

# Whether or not to autoscale aggressively. If this is enabled, if at any point
#   we would start more workers, we start at least enough to bring us to
#   initial_workers.
autoscaling_mode: default


# The autoscaler will scale up the cluster to this target fraction of resource
# usage. For example, if a cluster of 10 nodes is 100% busy and
# target_utilization is 0.8, it would resize the cluster to 13. This fraction
# can be decreased to increase the aggressiveness of upscaling.
# This value must be less than 1.0 for scaling to happen.
target_utilization_fraction: 0.48

# If a node is idle for this many minutes, it will be removed.
