  responsible for running the code that creates those objects. Second, some of
  these objects are expensive to create, and so they should be shared between
  tasks. However, if a task mutates a variable that is shared between tasks,
  then the behavior of the overall program may be nondeterministic (it could
  depend on scheduling decisions). To fix this, if a task uses a one of these
  shared objects, then that shared object will be reinitialized after the task
  finishes. Since the initialization may be expensive, the user can pass in
  custom reinitialization code that resets the state of the shared variable to
  the way it was after initialization. If the reinitialization code does not do
