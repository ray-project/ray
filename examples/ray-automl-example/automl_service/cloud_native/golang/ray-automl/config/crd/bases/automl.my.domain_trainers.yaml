                                    example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to
                                    2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                                    | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number
                                    of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global
                                    minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation,
                                    new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be
                                    scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 -
                                    0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three
                                    zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta

                                                dynamic provisioner. This field will
                                                replace the functionality of the DataSource
                                                field and as such if both fields are
                                                non-empty, they must have the same
                                                value. For backwards compatibility,
                                                both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef)
                                                will be set to the same value automatically
                                                if one of them is empty and the other
                                                is non-empty. There are two important
                                                differences between DataSource and
                                                DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                                only allows two specific types of
                                                objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                                non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                                objects. * While DataSource ignores
                                                disallowed values (dropping them),
                                                DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                                and generates an error if a disallowed
                                                value is specified. (Beta) Using this

                                        is specified then the Pod's namespace will
                                        be used.  This allows the Kubernetes name
                                        scoping to be mirrored within StorageOS for
                                        tighter integration. Set VolumeName to any
                                        name to override the default behaviour. Set
                                        to "default" if you are not using namespaces
                                        within StorageOS. Namespaces that do not pre-exist
                                        within StorageOS will be created.
