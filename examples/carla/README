(Experimental) gym environment for https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla

To run, first download and unpack the Carla release from this URL: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.7.0

Then, you can try running env.py to drive the car. Run train_ppo.py or train_dqn.py to attempt training.

    $ pkill -9 Carla
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/CARLA_0.7.0/PythonClient:$PYTHONPATH
    $ export CARLA_SERVER=/home/ubuntu/CARLA_0.7.0/CarlaUE4.sh
    $ python env.py

Note that the reward function is currently hard-coded to drive straight down the street.
