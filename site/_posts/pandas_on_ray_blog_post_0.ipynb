    "Recently, I was discussing the limitations of data science libraries with a friend who works with 100's of terabytes of biological data. When working with this kind of data, Pandas is often the most preferred tool; however, when you start processing terabytes of genomic data, Pandas on a single core becomes insufficient. We wanted Pandas to run faster if we had more cores, or to open files in the 10’s of terabyte scale. Currently, Apache Spark is the highest performing distributed alternative, but you can’t run your Pandas code without significant changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large scale data science has traditionally been left to distributed computing experts, or at least those familiar with the concepts. Most designers of distributed systems give users knobs to tune and expose a significant amount of system configuration. Thus, the tradeoff for incredible system performance is a significantly steeper learning curve. Most existing users probably just want Pandas to run faster and aren’t looking to optimize their workflows for their particular hardware setup. In my case, I want to use the same Pandas script for my 10KB dataset as my 10TB dataset, and have it run just as quickly if I had enough hardware resources. We started the __Pandas on Ray__ project to accomplish those goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our preliminary evaluations of the system, __Pandas on Ray__ accelerates Pandas queries by 4x on an 8-core machine, only requiring users to change a single line of code in their notebooks. We designed this system for existing Pandas users who would like their programs to run faster and scale better without significant code changes. The ultimate goal of this work is to be able to use Pandas in a cloud setting."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "__Pandas on Ray__ is an early stage DataFrame library that wraps Pandas and transparently distributes the data and computation. The user does not need to know how many cores their system or cluster has, nor do they need to specify how to distribute the data. In fact, users can continue using their previous Pandas notebooks while experiencing a considerable speedup from __Pandas on Ray__, even on a single machine. Only a modification of the import statement is needed, as we demonstrate below. Once you’ve changed your import statement, you’re ready to use __Pandas on Ray__ just like you would Pandas.\n",
    "\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "__Pandas on Ray__ is targeted towards existing Pandas users who are looking to improve performance and see faster runtimes without having to switch to another API. We are aggressively working to achieve functional parity with Pandas’ full API, and have so far implemented a subset of the API. We will go into detail about the current progress and give some usage examples. We hope you will give some feedback on the ideas and performance presented."

    "From here we can see that if we collect all of the data together with `[:]` operator, Pandas on Ray is about 36x slower. This is due to what is going on with the parallelization. All of the threads are executing in-parallel to read the file, then they are serializing their results. The main thread deserializes these values as they become available, so the overhead of (de)serialization is the main cost we're seeing here. Those of you familiar with Spark will recall that this is similar to a `.collect()` call. It takes things out of being run in-parallel and moves them into a single thread. So, while it's faster to read the file, the overhead of putting the pieces back together means that Pandas on Ray should be used for more than just reading the file. Let's check what happens when we look at the index right after we load the file."

    "The DataFrame library Dask also provides distributed DataFrames that run on its parallel processing framework and implements a subset of the Pandas API. In general, Dask currently runs faster than Pandas on Ray for most operations, and in future blogs we will highlight these differences. Dask provides fine-tuned customizations to Pandas users, while Pandas on Ray provides a way to achieve faster peformance with minimal effort and no distributed computing expertise. We are not targeting current Dask (or Spark) users with Pandas on Ray. Instead, we are focused on current Pandas users who would like to improve the performance and scalability of their existing and future workloads without the need to learn a new API. Dask is faster than Pandas on Ray for columnar operations, but it requires some extra knowledge beyond traditional Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major differences in Dask that Pandas on Ray tries to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user needs to constantly be aware that the data is distributed and computation is lazy.\n",
    "2. The tradeoff between multithreading and multiprocessing is a tradeoff between scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Scientists should think in DataFrames, not dynamic task graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask users will constantly ask themselves questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When should I trigger computation via `.compute()` and when should I just call a method to build the dynamic task graph? \n",
    "- When should I call `.persist()` to persist the DataFrame in memory?\n",
    "- Is this call efficient on Dask's distributed DataFrame?\n",
    "- When should I re-partition my DataFrame? \n",
    "- Does the call return a Dask DataFrame or a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A data scientist using Pandas doesn't have to be a distributed computing expert to make effective analyses of their data. Dask requires users to be constantly aware of the dynamic task graph that was built for computation. In addition, lazy computation by default makes every familiar Pandas call return an unexpected result. These differences give Dask a much better performance profile, but for some users the overhead of learning the new API is too high.\n",

However, if a Python process needs to send a small Pandas DataFrame to another process, this DataFrame must be serialized via Pickle and then be deserialized in the other process because the two processes do not share memory. Serializing, copying, and deserializing come with high performance cost. Even if this solution can scale to multiple cores, the overall performance is undermined by the high cost of communication.\n",

On column-wise operations, it is about 2.5x slower. This is because the current Pandas on Ray implementation is not yet optimized for columnar operations. In a future blog post, we will do some deeper benchmarking in order to better evaluate and compare these systems. It is worth noting that Dask's lazy evaluation and query execution planning cannot be taken advantage of in a single operation.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have started building Pandas on Ray, a library for distributing your Pandas workflows by changing only your import statement. As of today, we have implemented about 25% of the entire Pandas DataFrame API in about 45 days. We are excited about the potential of this project, and we're interested in hearing what you'd like to see. If you would like to request implementation for one of your favorite Pandas methods, feel free to open an issue at [github.com/ray-project/ray/issues](http://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues) and tell us what you'd like added next. Currently we are only accelerating Pandas on a single node, but soon we will have the functionality in place to work on Pandas in a cluster environment.\n",
