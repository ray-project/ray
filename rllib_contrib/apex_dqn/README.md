# APEX DQN (Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay)

[APEX DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00933.pdf) Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay is an algorithm that decouples
active learning from sampling. Actors interact with their own instances of the environment by selecting actions according
to a shared neural network, and accumulate the resulting experience in a shared experience replay memory; the learner replays samples of experience and updates the neural network. The architecture relies on prioritized experience replay to
focus only on the most significant data generated by the actors.
