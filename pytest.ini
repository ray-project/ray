# This fails because it's not a warning. I'm not sure why we only get it when warnings are considered errors.

# test_client_deprecation_warn -- Ray Client has tests that expect warnings to be thrown. Since we change that behavior, we have to change the tests
# to disable the error behavior.

# Why is this a RuntimeError / shouldn't this always be thrown?
# ignore:RuntimeError:Maybe you called ray.init twice by accident?:RuntimeError
# I think this is the same as test_client_deprecation_warn, or at least related.

# Note that these are interpreted as regex, so special regex tokens need to be escaped with `\\`.. Colons can't be used because they are the delimiter
# in the filterwarnings expression.
