  // of the entity that the event is associated with. For example, the entity ID of
  // a task is the pair of task ID and task attempt ID, for a driver job, it is the
  // driver job ID.
  //

  // 1. To associate the execution event with the definition event.
  // 2. To merge the individual execution events into a single execution event (single

  // 1. The two events have the same type and entity ID.
  // 2. The "other" event is the later event.
  // 3. Data points in both events are sorted by timestamp in ascending order.

  // For example, given three events:
  //
  // 1. event 1: {entity_id: "1", type: "task", state_transitions: [("started", 1000)]}
  // 2. event 2: {entity_id: "1", type: "task", state_transitions: [("running", 1001)]}
  // 3. event 3: {entity_id: "1", type: "task", state_transitions: [("completed", 1002)]}
  //
  // The merged event will be:
  //
  // {entity_id: "1", type: "task", state_transitions: [("started", 1000), ("running",
  // 1001),
  // ("completed", 1002)]}
