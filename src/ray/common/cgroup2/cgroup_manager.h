    Creates a CgroupManager after checking for the following invariants:

    1. cgroupv2 is mounted correctly in unified mode. For more details (@see
    CgroupDriverInterface::CheckCgroupv2Enabled).
    2. the current process has permissions to read and write to the base_cgroup.
    3. supported cgroup controllers are available (@see supported_controllers_).

    The CgroupManager will be used to
    1. construct the cgroup hierarchy.
    2. move processes into the appropriate cgroups.
    3. enable controllers and resource constraints.

    @param base_cgroup the cgroup that the process will take ownership of.
    @param node_id used to create a ray node cgroup.
    @param system_reserved_cpu_weight a value between [1,10000] to assign to the cgroup
    for system processes. The cgroup for application processes gets 10000 -
    system_reserved_cpu_weight.
    @param system_reserved_memory_bytes used to reserve memory for the system cgroup.
    @param cgroup_driver used to perform cgroup operations.

    @return Status::OK with an instance of CgroupManager if everything succeeds.
    @return Status::Invalid if cgroupv2 is not enabled correctly.
    @return Status::InvalidArgument if base_cgroup is not a cgroup.
    @return Status::NotFound if the base_cgroupd does not exist.
    @return Status::PermissionDenied if current user doesn't have read, write, and
