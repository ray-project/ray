  /// capacities: (1., 1., .7, 0.5) and deman of 1.2. Then we allocate one full
  /// instance and then allocate 0.2 of the 0.5 instance (as this is the instance
  /// with the smalest available capacity that can satisfy the remaining demand of 0.2).
  /// As a result remaining available capacities will be (0., 1., .7, .3).
  /// Thus, we will allocate a bunch of full instances and
  /// at most a fractional instance.
  ///
  /// During resource allocation with a placement group, no matter whether the
  /// allocation requirement specifies a bundle index, we generate the
  /// allocation on both the wildcard resource and the indexed resource. The
  /// resource_demand won't be assigned across bundles. And If no bundle index is
  /// specified, we will iterate through the bundles and find the first bundle that can
  /// fit the required resources. In addition, for unit resources, we make sure
  /// that the allocation on the wildcard resource and the indexed resource are
  /// consistent, meaning the same instance ids should be allocated.
  ///
  /// For example, considering the GPU resource on a host. Assuming the host has 3 GPUs
  /// and 1 placement group with 2 bundles. The bundle with index 1 contains 1 GPU and
  /// the bundle with index 2 contains 2 GPU.
  ///
  /// The current node resource can be as follows:
  /// resource id: total, available
  /// GPU: [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]
  /// GPU_<pg_id>: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]
  /// GPU_1_<pg_id>: [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0]
  /// GPU_2_<pg_id>: [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]
  ///
  /// Now, we want to allocate a task with 2 GPUs and in the placement group <pg_id>,
  /// reflecting in the following resource demand:
  /// GPU_<pg_id> : 2
  ///
  /// We will iterate though all the bundles in the placement group and bundle with
  /// index=2 has the required capacity. So we will allocate the task to the 2 GPUs in
  /// bundle 2 in placement group <pg_id> and the same allocation should be reflected in
  /// the wildcard GPU resource. So the allocation will be:
  /// GPU_<pg_id> : [0, 1, 1]
  /// GPU_2_<pg_id> : [0, 1, 1]
  ///
  /// And as a result, after the allocation, current node resource will be:
  /// resource id: total, available
  /// GPU: [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]
  /// GPU_<pg_id>: [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0]
