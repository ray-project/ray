All proto files in this directory are part of public APIs. Therefore, please keep the
following guidelines in mind when modifying any of these files:

Do NOT include private protos in these files. If you need to, either (i) obtain approval
from the core team to make the previously private proto public, or (ii) split the proto
into private and public parts, and move only the public part here.

Do NOT delete existing fields in any proto messages. If renaming is necessary, add a new
field with the new name, and mark the old field as deprecated.

For consumers of these proto files (end users): you can rely on field names continuing
to exist, ensuring that applications built on top of these protos do not break
unexpectedly. However, always design applications with the assumption that fields are
always optional, and handle missing or deprecated field contents gracefully. While a
field name may remain, its content could eventually be deprecated and moved to a new
field. This provides a path for us to deprecate emitting logic without breaking your
application.
