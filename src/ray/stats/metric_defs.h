/// The definitions of metrics that you can use everywhere.
///
/// There are 4 types of metric:
///   Histogram: Histogram distribution of metric points.
///   Gauge: Keeps the last recorded value, drops everything before.
///   Count: The count of the number of metric points.
///   Sum: A sum up of the metric points.
///
/// You can follow these examples to define your metrics.
