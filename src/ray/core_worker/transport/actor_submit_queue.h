 * IActorSubmitQueue is responsible for queuing per actor requests on the client.
 * To use ActorSubmitQueue, user should Emplace a task with a monotincally increasing
 * (and unique) sequence_no.
 * The task is not ready until it's being marked as
 * MarkDependencyResolved; and being removed from the queue if it's beking marked as
 * MarkDependencyFailed.
 * The caller should call PopNextTaskToSend to find next task to send.
 * This queue is also aware of client connection/reconnection, so it needs to
 * call OnClientConnected whenever client is connected, and use GetSequenceNumber
 * to know the actual sequence_no to send over the network.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe.
 * TODO(scv119): the protocol could be improved.
