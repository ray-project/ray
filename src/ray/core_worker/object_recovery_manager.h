  /// If the pinning is successful, then mark the recovery as a success by
  /// storing a new value for the object in the direct memory store.
  /// 3. If pinning fails at all locations for the object (or there are no
  /// locations), attempt to reconstruct the object by resubmitting the task
  /// that created the object. If the task resubmission fails, then the
  /// fail the recovery operation.
