/// Concrete implementation of `ShutdownExecutorInterface` that executes actual
/// shutdown operations for `CoreWorker`.
///
/// Semantics overview:
/// - Graceful shutdown (ExecuteGracefulShutdown): stop accepting new work, drain ongoing
/// work, flush task
///   events, stop services (task execution service, gRPC server, IO service),
///   disconnect from the GCS/raylet, and join the IO thread if safe. This path
///   attempts best-effort cleanup to preserve observability and avoid resource
///   leaks. It may take up to `timeout_ms` for certain steps.
/// - Force shutdown (ExecuteForceShutdown): immediately kill child processes, disconnect
/// services, and
///   terminate the process without draining or cleanup. This path is used to
///   break out of hung or long-running shutdowns and should be considered
///   preemptive; it sacrifices cleanup for determinism.
/// - Worker exit (ExecuteWorkerExit): worker-type-specific graceful
///   shutdown that handles task draining and optional actor creation failure
///   payloads, then proceeds with the graceful sequence.
/// - Handle exit (ExecuteHandleExit): conditional exit that first checks worker
///   idleness and only proceeds when idle; otherwise it is ignored.
