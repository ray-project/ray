///   1. If any of the gRPC call failed, the task events will be dropped and warnings
///   logged. This is probably fine since this usually indicated a much worse issue.
///
///   2. More than `RAY_task_events_max_num_task_events_in_buffer` tasks have been stored
///   in the buffer, any new task events will be dropped. In this case, the number of
///   dropped task events will also be included in the next flush to surface this.
///
/// No overloading of GCS
/// =====================
/// If GCS failed to respond quickly enough to the previous report, reporting of events to
/// GCS will be delayed until GCS replies the gRPC in future intervals.
