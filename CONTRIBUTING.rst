PR Review Process
-----------------

For contributors who are in the ray-project organization:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When you first create a PR, add an reviewer to the `assignee` section.
- Assignees will review your PR and add `@author-action-required` label if further actions are required.
- Address their comments and remove `@author-action-required` label from the PR.
- Repeat this process until assignees approve your PR.
- Once the PR is approved, the author is in charge of ensuring the PR passes the build. Add `test-ok` label if the build succeeds.
- Committers will merge the PR once the build is passing.

For contributors who are not in the ray-project organization:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Your PRs will have assignees shortly. Assignees or PRs will be actively engaging with contributors to merge the PR.
- Please actively ping assignees after you address your comments!
