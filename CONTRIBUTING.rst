Contributing to Ray
===================

Reporting bugs and asking questions
-----------------------------------

We use `GitHub issues`_ for bug reports and feature requests. For discussions
about development, questions about usage, or any general questions, we use our
mailing list `ray-dev@googlegroups.com`_.

To contribute a patch:
----------------------

1. Break your work into small, single-purpose patches if possible. It's much
   harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint features.
2. Submit the patch as a GitHub pull request against the master branch.
3. Make sure that your code passes the unit tests.
4. Add new unit tests for your code.
