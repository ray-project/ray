      description: >
        Please provide a reproducible script. Providing a narrow reproduction (minimal / no external dependencies) will
        help us triage and address issues in the timely manner!
      placeholder: >
        Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to
        reproduce the issue. The snippet should have **no external library dependencies**
        (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments).

        **NOTE**: If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be marked as "needs-repro-script"
        until the repro instruction is updated.
