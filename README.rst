Ray is a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. Ray consists of a core distributed runtime and a toolkit of libraries (Ray AIR) for simplifying ML compute:

Learn more about `Ray AIR`_ and its libraries:

- `Datasets`_: Distributed Data Preprocessing
- `Train`_: Distributed Training
- `Tune`_: Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
- `RLlib`_: Scalable Reinforcement Learning
- `Serve`_: Scalable and Programmable Serving

Or more about `Ray Core`_ and its key abstractions:

- `Tasks`_: Stateless functions executed in the cluster.
- `Actors`_: Stateful worker processes created in the cluster.
- `Objects`_: Immutable values accessible across the cluster.

Ray runs on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes, and features a growing
`ecosystem of community integrations`_.

Install Ray with: ``pip install ray``. For nightly wheels, see the
`Installation page <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__.

Why Ray?
--------

Today's ML workloads are increasingly compute-intensive. As convenient as they are, single-node development environments such as your laptop cannot scale to meet these demands.

Ray is a unified way to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a cluster.

With Ray, you can seamlessly scale the same code from a laptop to a cluster. Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.
