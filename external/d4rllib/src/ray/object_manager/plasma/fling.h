// FLING: Exchanging file descriptors over sockets
//
// This is a little library for sending file descriptors over a socket
// between processes. The reason for doing that (as opposed to using
// filenames to share the files) is so (a) no files remain in the
// filesystem after all the processes terminate, (b) to make sure that
// there are no name collisions and (c) to be able to control who has
// access to the data.
//
// Most of the code is from https://github.com/sharvil/flingfd
