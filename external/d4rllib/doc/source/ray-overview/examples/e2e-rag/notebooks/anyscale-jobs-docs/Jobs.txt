Jobs
Run discrete workloads in production such as batch inference, bulk embeddings generation, or
model fine-tuning.
Anyscale Jobs allow you to submit applications developed on workspaces to a standalone Ray
cluster for execution. Built for production and designed to fit into your CI/CD pipeline, jobs ensure
scalable and reliable performance.
How does it work? #
When youâ€™re ready to promote an app to production, submit a job
from the workspace using
anyscale job submit . Anyscale Jobs have the following features:
Scalability: Rapid scaling to thousands of cloud instances, adjusting computing resources to
match application demand.
Fault tolerance: Retries for failures and automatic rescheduling to an alternative cluster for
unexpected failures like running out of memory.
Monitoring and observability: Persistent dashboards that allow you to observe tasks in real
time and email alerts upon successf
ul job completion.
