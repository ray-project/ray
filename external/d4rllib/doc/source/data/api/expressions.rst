Expressions API
===============

.. currentmodule:: ray.data.expressions

Expressions provide a way to specify column-based operations on datasets.
Use :func:`col` to reference columns and :func:`lit` to create literal values.
These can be combined with operators to create complex expressions for filtering,
transformations, and computations.
