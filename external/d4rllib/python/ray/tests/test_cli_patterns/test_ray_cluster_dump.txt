You are about to create a cluster dump\. This will collect data from cluster nodes\.

The dump will contain this information:

  - The logfiles of your Ray session
    This usually includes Python outputs \(stdout/stderr\)
  - Debug state information on your Ray cluster
    e\.g\. number of workers, drivers, objects, etc\.
  - Your installed Python packages \(`pip freeze`\)

If you are concerned about leaking private information, extract the archive and inspect its contents before sharing it with anyone\.
