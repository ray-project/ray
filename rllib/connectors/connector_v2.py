class ConnectorV2(Checkpointable, abc.ABC):
    """Base class defining the API for an individual "connector piece".

    A ConnectorV2 ("connector piece") is usually part of a whole series of connector
    pieces within a so-called connector pipeline, which in itself also abides to this
    very API.
    For example, you might have a connector pipeline consisting of two connector pieces,
    A and B, both instances of subclasses of ConnectorV2 and each one performing a
    particular transformation on their input data. The resulting connector pipeline
    (A->B) itself also abides to this very ConnectorV2 API and could thus be part of yet
    another, higher-level connector pipeline, e.g. (A->B)->C->D.

    Any ConnectorV2 instance (individual pieces or several connector pieces in a
    pipeline) is a callable and users should override the `__call__()` method.
    When called, they take the outputs of a previous connector piece (or an empty dict
    if there are no previous pieces) and all the data collected thus far in the
    ongoing episode(s) (only applies to connectors used in EnvRunners) or retrieved
    from a replay buffer or from an environment sampling step (only applies to
    connectors used in Learner pipelines). From this input data, a ConnectorV2 then
    performs a transformation step.

    There are 3 types of pipelines any ConnectorV2 piece can belong to:
    1) EnvToModulePipeline: The connector transforms environment data before it gets to
    the RLModule. This type of pipeline is used by an EnvRunner for transforming
    env output data into RLModule readable data (for the next RLModule forward pass).
    For example, such a pipeline would include observation postprocessors, -filters,
    or any RNN preparation code related to time-sequences and zero-padding.
    2) ModuleToEnvPipeline: This type of pipeline is used by an
    EnvRunner to transform RLModule output data to env readable actions (for the next
    `env.step()` call). For example, in case the RLModule only outputs action
    distribution parameters (but not actual actions), the ModuleToEnvPipeline would
    take care of sampling the actions to be sent back to the end from the
    resulting distribution (made deterministic if exploration is off).
    3) LearnerConnectorPipeline: This connector pipeline type transforms data coming
    from an `EnvRunner.sample()` call or a replay buffer and will then be sent into the
    RLModule's `forward_train()` method in order to compute loss function inputs.
    This type of pipeline is used by a Learner worker to transform raw training data
    (a batch or a list of episodes) to RLModule readable training data (for the next
    RLModule `forward_train()` call).

    Some connectors might be stateful, for example for keeping track of observation
    filtering stats (mean and stddev values). Any Algorithm, which uses connectors is
    responsible for frequently synchronizing the states of all connectors and connector
    pipelines between the EnvRunners (owning the env-to-module and module-to-env
    pipelines) and the Learners (owning the Learner pipelines).

                observations from the episodes and place them into `batch`, then
                transform these observations, and would like to make these
                transformations permanent (note that `batch` gets discarded after the
                RLModule forward pass), then you have to write the transformed
                observations back into the episode to make sure you do not have to
                perform the same transformation again on the learner (or replay buffer)

                compile the train batch using the Learner connector).
            explore: Whether `explore` is currently on. Per convention, if True, the
                RLModule's `forward_exploration` method should be called, if False, the
