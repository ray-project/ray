    An agent connector transforms a list of agent data in AgentConnectorDataType
    format into a new list in the same AgentConnectorDataTypes format.
    The input API is designed so agent connectors can have access to all the
    agents assigned to a particular policy.

    AgentConnectorDataTypes can be used to specify arbitrary type of env data,

    Example:

        Represent a list of agent data from one env step() call.

        .. testcode::

            import numpy as np
            ac = AgentConnectorDataType(
                env_id="env_1",
                agent_id=None,
                data={
                    "agent_1": np.array([1, 2, 3]),
                    "agent_2": np.array([4, 5, 6]),
                }
            )

        Or a single agent data ready to be preprocessed.

        .. testcode::

            ac = AgentConnectorDataType(
                env_id="env_1",

                data=np.array([1, 2, 3]),
            )
