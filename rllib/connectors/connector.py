class AgentConnector(Connector):
    """Connector connecting user environments to RLlib policies.

    An agent connector transforms a single piece of data in AgentConnectorDataType
    format into a list of data in the same AgentConnectorDataTypes format.
    The API is designed so multi-agent observations can be broken and emitted as
    multiple single agent observations.

    AgentConnectorDataTypes can be used to specify arbitrary type of env data,

    Example:
    .. code-block:: python
        # A dict of multi-agent data from one env step() call.
        ac = AgentConnectorDataType(
            env_id="env_1",
            agent_id=None,
            data={
                "agent_1": np.array(...),
                "agent_2": np.array(...),
            }
        )

    Example:
    .. code-block:: python
        # Single agent data ready to be preprocessed.
        ac = AgentConnectorDataType(
            env_id="env_1",
            agent_id="agent_1",
            data=np.array(...)
        )

    We can adapt a simple stateless function into an agent connector by using
    register_lambda_agent_connector:
    .. code-block:: python
        TimesTwoAgentConnector = register_lambda_agent_connector(
            "TimesTwoAgentConnector", lambda data: data * 2
        )

    More complicated agent connectors can be implemented by extending this
    AgentConnector class:

    Example:
    .. code-block:: python
        class FrameSkippingAgentConnector(AgentConnector):
            def __init__(self, n):
                self._n = n
                self._frame_count = default_dict(str, default_dict(str, int))

            def reset(self, env_id: str):
                del self._frame_count[env_id]

            def __call__(
                self, ac_data: AgentConnectorDataType
            ) -> List[AgentConnectorDataType]:
                assert ac_data.env_id and ac_data.agent_id, (
                    "Frame skipping works per agent")

                count = self._frame_count[ac_data.env_id][ac_data.agent_id]
                self._frame_count[ac_data.env_id][ac_data.agent_id] = count + 1

                return [ac_data] if count % self._n == 0 else []

    As shown, an agent connector may choose to emit an empty list to stop input
    observations from being prosessed further.
