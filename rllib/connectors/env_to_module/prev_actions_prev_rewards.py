    - Requires Columns.OBS to be already a part of the batch.
    - This connector makes the assumption that under the Columns.OBS key in batch,
    there is either a list of individual env observations to be flattened (single-agent
    case) or a dict mapping (AgentID, ModuleID)-tuples to lists of data items to be
    flattened (multi-agent case).
    - Converts Columns.OBS data into a dict (or creates a sub-dict if obs are
    already a dict), and adds "prev_rewards" and "prev_actions"
    to this dict. The original observations are stored under the self.ORIG_OBS_KEY in
    that dict.
    - If your RLModule does not handle dict inputs, you will have to plug in an
    `FlattenObservations` connector piece after this one.
    - Does NOT work in a Learner pipeline as it operates on individual observation
    items (as opposed to batched/time-ranked data).
    - Therefore, assumes that the altered (flattened) observations will be written
    back into the episode by a later connector piece in the env-to-module pipeline
    (which this piece is part of as well).
    - Only reads reward- and action information from the given list of Episode objects.
    - Does NOT write any observations (or other data) to the given Episode objects.
