    """Default connector piece added by RLlib to the end of any module-to-env pipeline.

    If necessary, this connector samples actions, given action dist. inputs and a
    dist. class.
    The connector will only sample from the action distribution, if the
    SampleBatch.ACTIONS key cannot be found in `input_`. Otherwise, it'll behave
    as pass through (noop). If SampleBatch.ACTIONS is not present, but
    SampleBatch.ACTION_DIST_INPUTS are, the connector will create a new action
    distribution using the RLModule in the connector context and sample from this
    distribution (deterministically, if we are not exploring, stochastically, if we
    are).

    input_type: INPUT_OUTPUT_TYPES.DICT_OF_MODULE_IDS_TO_DATA
        Operates per RLModule as it will have to pull the action distribution from each
        in order to sample actions if necessary. Searches for the ACTIONS and
        ACTION_DIST_INPUTS keys in a module's outputs and - should ACTIONS not be
        found - sample actions from the module's action distribution.
    output_type: INPUT_OUTPUT_TYPES.DICT_OF_MODULE_IDS_TO_DATA (same as input: data in,
        data out, however, data
        out might contain an additional ACTIONS key if it was not previously present
        in the input).
