"""Contributed port of MADDPG from OpenAI baselines.

The implementation has a couple assumptions:
- The number of agents is fixed and known upfront.
- Each agent is bound to a policy of the same name.
- Discrete actions are sent as logits (pre-softmax).

For a minimal example, see twostep_game.py, and the README for how to run
with the multi-agent particle envs.
