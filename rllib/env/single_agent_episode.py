class SingleAgentEpisode:
    """A class representing RL environment episodes for individual agents.

    SingleAgentEpisode stores observations, info dicts, actions, rewards, and all
    module outputs (e.g. state outs, action logp, etc..) for an individual agent within
    some single-agent or multi-agent environment.
    The two main APIs to add data to an ongoing episode are the `add_env_reset()`
    and `add_env_step()` methods, which should be called passing the outputs of the
    respective gym.Env API calls: `env.reset()` and `env.step()`.

    A SingleAgentEpisode might also only represent a chunk of an episode, which is
    useful for cases, in which partial (non-complete episode) sampling is performed
    and collected episode data has to be returned before the actual gym.Env episode has
    finished (see `SingleAgentEpisode.cut()`). In order to still maintain visibility
    onto past experiences within such a "cut" episode, SingleAgentEpisode instances
    can have a "lookback buffer" of n timesteps at their beginning (left side), which
    solely exists for the purpose of compiling extra data (e.g. "prev. reward"), but
    is not considered part of the finished/packaged episode (b/c the data in the
    lookback buffer is already part of a previous episode chunk).

    Powerful getter methods, such as `get_observations()` help collect different types
    of data from the episode at individual time indices or time ranges, including the
    "lookback buffer" range described above. For example, to extract the last 4 rewards
    of an ongoing episode, one can call `self.get_rewards(slice(-4, None))` or
    `self.rewards[-4:]`. This would work, even if the ongoing SingleAgentEpisode is
    a continuation chunk from a much earlier started episode, as long as it has a
    lookback buffer size of sufficient size.

    Examples:

    .. testcode::

        import gymnasium as gym

        from ray.rllib.env.single_agent_episode import SingleAgentEpisode

        # Construct a new episode (without any data in it yet).
        episode = SingleAgentEpisode()
        assert len(episode) == 0

        # Fill the episode with some data (10 timesteps).
        env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
        obs, infos = env.reset()
        episode.add_env_reset(obs, infos)

        # Even with the initial obs/infos, the episode is still considered len=0.
        assert len(episode) == 0
        for _ in range(5):
            action = env.action_space.sample()
            obs, reward, term, trunc, infos = env.step(action)
            episode.add_env_step(
                observation=obs,
                action=action,
                reward=reward,
                terminated=term,
                truncated=trunc,
                infos=infos,
            )
        assert len(episode) == 5

        # We can now access information from the episode via the getter APIs.

        # Get the last 3 rewards (in a batch of size 3).
        episode.get_rewards(slice(-3, None))  # same as `episode.rewards[-3:]`

        # Get the most recent action (single item, not batched).
        # This works regardless of the action space or whether the episode has
        # been finalized or not (see below).
        episode.get_actions(-1)  # same as episode.actions[-1]

        # Looking back from ts=1, get the previous 4 rewards AND fill with 0.0
        # in case we go over the beginning (ts=0). So we would expect
        # [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, r0] to be returned here, where r0 is the very first received
        # reward in the episode:
        episode.get_rewards(slice(-4, 0), neg_indices_left_of_zero=True, fill=0.0)

        # Note the use of fill=0.0 here (fill everything that's out of range with this
        # value) AND the argument `neg_indices_left_of_zero=True`, which interprets
        # negative indices as being left of ts=0 (e.g. -1 being the timestep before
        # ts=0).

        # Assuming we had a complex action space (nested gym.spaces.Dict) with one or
        # more elements being Discrete or MultiDiscrete spaces:
        # 1) The `fill=...` argument would still work, filling all spaces (Boxes,
        # Discrete) with that provided value.
        # 2) Setting the flag `one_hot_discrete=True` would convert those discrete
        # sub-components automatically into one-hot (or multi-one-hot) tensors.
        # This simplifies the task of having to provide the previous 4 (nested and
        # partially discrete/multi-discrete) actions for each timestep within a training
        # batch, thereby filling timesteps before the episode started with 0.0s and
        # one-hot'ing the discrete/multi-discrete components in these actions:

        Args:
            id_: Unique identifier for this episode. If no ID is provided the
                constructor generates a unique hexadecimal code for the id.
            observations: Either a list of individual observations from a sampling or
                an already instantiated `InfiniteLookbackBuffer` object (possibly
                with observation data in it). If a list, will construct the buffer

                should abide to. If not None and this SingleAgentEpisode is finalized
                (via the `self.finalize()` method), and data is appended or set, the new

                an already instantiated `InfiniteLookbackBuffer` object (possibly
                with info dicts in it). If a list, will construct the buffer
                automatically (given the data and the `len_lookback_buffer` argument).

                with info dict] data in it). If a list, will construct the buffer

            action_space: An optional gym.Space, which all individual actions
                should abide to. If not None and this SingleAgentEpisode is finalized
                (via the `self.finalize()` method), and data is appended or set, the new
                data will be checked for correctness.
            rewards: Either a list of individual rewards from a sampling or
                an already instantiated `InfiniteLookbackBuffer` object (possibly
                with reward data in it). If a list, will construct the buffer
                automatically (given the data and the `len_lookback_buffer` argument).
            extra_model_outputs: A dict mapping string keys to either lists of
                individual extra model output tensors (e.g. `action_logp` or
                `state_outs`) from a sampling or to already instantiated
                `InfiniteLookbackBuffer` object (possibly with extra model output data
                in it). If mapping is to lists, will construct the buffers automatically
                (given the data and the `len_lookback_buffer` argument).
            render_images: An optional list of RGB uint8 images from rendering
                the environment.
            terminated: A boolean indicating, if the episode is already terminated.
            truncated: A boolean indicating, if the episode has been truncated.
            t_started: Optional. The starting timestep of the episode. The default
                is zero. If data is provided, the starting point is from the last
                observation onwards (i.e. `t_started = len(observations) - 1). If
                this parameter is provided the episode starts at the provided value.
            len_lookback_buffer: The size of the (optional) lookback buffers to keep in
                front of this Episode for each type of data (observations, actions,
                etc..). If larger 0, will interpret the first `len_lookback_buffer`
                items in each type of data as NOT part of this actual
                episode chunk, but instead serve as "historical" record that may be
                viewed and used to derive new data from. For example, it might be
                necessary to have a lookback buffer of four if you would like to do
                observation frame stacking and your episode has been cut and you are now
                operating on a new chunk (continuing from the cut one). Then, for the
                first 3 items, you would have to be able to look back into the old
                chunk's data.
                If `len_lookback_buffer` is "auto" (default), will interpret all
                provided data in the constructor as part of the lookback buffers.
            agent_id: An optional AgentID indicating which agent this episode belongs
                to. This information is stored under `self.agent_id` and only serves
                reference purposes.
            module_id: An optional ModuleID indicating which RLModule this episode
                belongs to. Normally, this information is obtained by querying an
                `agent_to_module_mapping_fn` with a given agent ID. This information
                is stored under `self.module_id` and only serves reference purposes.

            neg_indices_left_of_zero: If True, negative values in `indices` are

            fill: An optional value to use for filling up the returned results at
                the boundaries. This filling only happens if the requested index range's
                start/stop boundaries exceed the episode's boundaries (including the
                lookback buffer on the left side). This comes in very handy, if users
                don't want to worry about reaching such boundaries and want to zero-pad.
                For example, an episode with observations [10, 11,  12, 13, 14] and
                lookback buffer size of 2 (meaning observations `10` and `11` are part

            one_hot_discrete: If True, will return one-hot vectors (instead of
                int-values) for those sub-components of a (possibly complex) observation
                space that are Discrete or MultiDiscrete.  Note that if `fill=0` and the
                requested `indices` are out of the range of our data, the returned
                one-hot vectors will actually be zero-hot (all slots zero).
