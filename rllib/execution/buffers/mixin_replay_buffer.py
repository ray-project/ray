class MixInMultiAgentReplayBuffer:
    """This buffer adds replayed samples to a stream of new experiences.

    - Any newly added batch (`add_batch()`) is immediately returned upon
    the next `replay` call (close to on-policy) as well as being moved
    into the buffer.
    - Additionally, a certain number of old samples is mixed into the
    returned sample according to a given "replay ratio".
    - If >1 calls to `add_batch()` are made without any `replay()` calls
    in between, all newly added batches are returned (plus some older samples
    according to the "replay ratio").

        >>> from ray.rllib.execution.replay_buffer import MixInMultiAgentReplayBuffer
        # replay ratio 0.66 (2/3 replayed, 1/3 new samples):
        >>> buffer = MixInMultiAgentReplayBuffer(capacity=100, # doctest: +SKIP
