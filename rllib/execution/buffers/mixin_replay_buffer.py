class MixInMultiAgentReplayBuffer:
    """This buffer adds replayed samples to a stream of new experiences.

    - Any newly added batch (`add_batch()`) is immediately returned upon
    the next `replay` call (close to on-policy) as well as being moved
    into the buffer.
    - Additionally, a certain number of old samples is mixed into the
    returned sample according to a given "replay ratio".
    - If >1 calls to `add_batch()` are made without any `replay()` calls
    in between, all newly added batches are returned (plus some older samples
    according to the "replay ratio").

    Examples:
        # replay ratio 0.66 (2/3 replayed, 1/3 new samples):
        >>> buffer = MixInMultiAgentReplayBuffer(capacity=100,
        ...                                      replay_ratio=0.66)

        >>> buffer.add_batch(<B>)
        >>> buffer.replay()

        >>> buffer.add_batch(<C>)

        >>> # or: [<C>, <A>, <A>] or [<C>, <B>, <B>], but always <C> as it
        >>> # is the newest sample

        >>> buffer.add_batch(<D>)
        >>> buffer.replay()
        ... [<D>, <A>, <C>]
