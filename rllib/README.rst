RLlib: Industry-Grade Reinforcement Learning with TF and Torch
==============================================================

**RLlib** is an open-source library for reinforcement learning (RL), offering support for
production-level, highly distributed RL workloads, while maintaining
unified and simple APIs for a large variety of industry applications.

Whether you would like to train your agents in multi-agent setups,
purely from offline (historic) datasets, or using externally
connected simulators, RLlib offers simple solutions for your decision making needs.

You **don't need** to be an **RL expert** to use RLlib, nor do you need to learn Ray or any
other of its libraries! If you either have your problem coded (in python) as an
`RL environment <https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/anatomy-of-a-custom-environment-for-rllib-327157f269e5>`_
or own lots of pre-recorded, historic behavioral data to learn from, you will be
up and running in only a few days.

RLlib is already used in production by industry leaders in many different verticals, such as
`climate control <https://www.anyscale.com/events/2021/06/23/applying-ray-and-rllib-to-real-life-industrial-use-cases>`_,
`manufacturing and logistics <https://www.anyscale.com/events/2021/06/22/offline-rl-with-rllib>`_,

            # same.

            return self.cur_obs, reward, done, {}


    # Create an RLlib Trainer instance to learn how to act in the above
    # environment.
    trainer = PPOTrainer(
        config={
            # Env class to use (here: our gym.Env sub-class from above).
            "env": ParrotEnv,
            # Config dict to be passed to our custom env's constructor.
            "env_config": {

            "num_workers": 3,
        })

    # Train for n iterations and report results (mean episode rewards).
    # Since we have to guess 10 times and the optimal reward is 0.0
    # (exact match between observation and action value),
    # we can expect to reach an optimal episode reward of 0.0.
    for i in range(5):
        results = trainer.train()
        print(f"Iter: {i}; avg. reward={results['episode_reward_mean']}")


After training, you may want to perform action computations (inference) in your environment.
Below is a minimal example on how to do this. Also
`check out our more detailed examples here <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib/examples/inference_and_serving>`_
(in particular for `normal models <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/inference_and_serving/policy_inference_after_training.py>`_,
`LSTMs <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/inference_and_serving/policy_inference_after_training_with_lstm.py>`_,
and `attention nets <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/inference_and_serving/policy_inference_after_training_with_attention.py>`_).


.. code-block:: python

    # Perform inference (action computations) based on given env observations.
    # Note that we are using a slightly simpler env here (-3.0 to 3.0, instead
    # of -5.0 to 5.0!), however, this should still work as the agent has
    # (hopefully) learned to "just always repeat the observation!".
    env = ParrotEnv({"parrot_shriek_range": gym.spaces.Box(-3.0, 3.0, (1, ))})
    # Get the initial observation (some value between -10.0 and 10.0).
    obs = env.reset()
    done = False
    total_reward = 0.0
    # Play one episode.
    while not done:
        # Compute a single action, given the current observation
        # from the environment.
        action = trainer.compute_single_action(obs)
        # Apply the computed action in the environment.
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        # Sum up rewards for reporting purposes.
        total_reward += reward
    # Report results.
    print(f"Shreaked for 1 episode; total-reward={total_reward}")

Highlighted Features
--------------------

The following is a summary of RLlib's most striking features (for an in-depth overview,
check out our `documentation <http://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib/index.html>`_):

The most **popular deep-learning frameworks**: `PyTorch <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/custom_torch_policy.py>`_ and `TensorFlow
(tf1.x/2.x static-graph/eager/traced) <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/custom_tf_policy.py>`_.

**Highly distributed learning**: Our RLlib algorithms (such as our "PPO" or "IMPALA")
allow you to set the ``num_workers`` config parameter, such that your workloads can run
on 100s of CPUs/nodes thus parallelizing and speeding up learning.

**Vectorized (batched) and remote (parallel) environments**: RLlib auto-vectorizes
your ``gym.Envs`` via the ``num_envs_per_worker`` config. Environment workers can
then batch and thus significantly speedup the action computing forward pass.
On top of that, RLlib offers the ``remote_worker_envs`` config to create
`single environments (within a vectorized one) as ray Actors <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/remote_base_env_with_custom_api.py>`_,
thus parallelizing even the env stepping process.

| **Multi-agent RL** (MARL): Convert your (custom) ``gym.Envs`` into a multi-agent one
  via a few simple steps and start training your agents in any of the following fashions:
| 1) Cooperative with `shared <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/centralized_critic.py>`_ or
  `separate <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/two_step_game.py>`_
  policies and/or value functions.
| 2) Adversarial scenarios using `self-play <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/self_play_with_open_spiel.py>`_
  and `league-based training <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/self_play_league_based_with_open_spiel.py>`_.
| 3) `Independent learning <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/multi_agent_independent_learning.py>`_
  of neutral/co-existing agents.


**External simulators**: Don't have your simulation running as a gym.Env in python?
No problem! RLlib supports an external environment API and comes with a pluggable,
off-the-shelve
`client <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/serving/cartpole_client.py>`_/
`server <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/serving/cartpole_server.py>`_
setup that allows you to run 100s of independent simulators on the "outside"
(e.g. a Windows cloud) connecting to a central RLlib Policy-Server that learns
and serves actions. Alternatively, actions can be computed on the client side
to save on network traffic.

**Offline RL and imitation learning/behavior cloning**: You don't have a simulator
for your particular problem, but tons of historic data recorded by a legacy (maybe
non-RL/ML) system? This branch of reinforcement learning is for you!
RLlib's comes with several `offline RL <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/offline_rl.py>`_
algorithms (*CQL*, *MARWIL*, and *DQfD*), allowing you to either purely
`behavior-clone <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/agents/marwil/tests/test_bc.py>`_
your existing system or learn how to further improve over it.
