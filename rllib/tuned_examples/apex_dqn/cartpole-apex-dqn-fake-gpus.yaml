# Note here that with < 3 workers, APEX can behave a little unstably
# due to the (static) per-worker-epsilon distribution, which also makes
# evaluation w/o evaluation worker set harder.
# For an epsilon-free/greedy evaluation, use:
# evaluation_interval: 1
# evaluation_config:
#     explore: False
