"""
Tests, whether APPO can learn in a fault-tolerant fashion in a
multi-agent setting.

Workers will be configured to automatically get recreated upon failures (here: within
the environment).
The environment we use here is configured to crash with a certain probability on each
`step()` and/or `reset()` call.
