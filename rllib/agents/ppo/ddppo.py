"""Decentralized Distributed PPO implementation.

Unlike APPO or PPO, learning is no longer done centralized in the trainer
process. Instead, gradients are computed remotely on each rollout worker and
all-reduced to sync them at each mini-batch. This allows each worker's GPU
to be used both for sampling and for training.

DD-PPO should be used if you have envs that require GPUs to function, or have
a very large model that cannot be effectively optimized with the GPUs available
on a single machine (DD-PPO allows scaling to arbitrary numbers of GPUs across
multiple nodes, unlike PPO/APPO which is limited to GPUs on a single node).

Paper reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00357
Note that unlike the paper, we currently do not implement straggler mitigation.
