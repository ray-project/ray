        randomly shuffled. In RLlib it is implemented as a custom OffPolicyEstimator
        which is used to evaluate RLlib policies without performing environment
        interactions.

        evaluate the policy and the each feature's importance is computed after each
        training iteration. The permutation are repeated `self.repeat` times and the
        results are averages across repeats.
