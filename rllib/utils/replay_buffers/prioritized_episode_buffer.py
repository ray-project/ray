class PrioritizedEpisodeReplayBuffer(EpisodeReplayBuffer):
    """Prioritized Replay Buffer that stores episodes by their ID.

    This replay buffer stores episode data (more specifically `SingleAgentEpisode`
    objects) and implements prioritized experience replay first proposed
    in the paper by Schaul et al. (2016, https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952).

    Implementation is based on segment trees as suggested by the authors of
    the cited paper, i.e. we use proportional prioritization with an order
    of O(log N) in updating and sampling.

    Each "row" (a slot in a deque) in the buffer is occupied by one episode. If an
    incomplete episode is added to the buffer and then another chunk of that episode is
    added at a later time, the buffer will automatically concatenate the new fragment to
    the original episode. This way, episodes can be completed via subsequent `add`
    calls.

    Sampling returns a size `B` episode list (number of 'rows'), where each episode
    holds a tuple tuple of the form

    `(o_t, a_t, sum(r_t+1:t+n), o_t+n)`

    where `o_t` is the observation in `t`, `a_t` the action chosen at observation `o_t`,
    `o_t+n` is the observation `n` timesteps later and `sum(r_t+1:t+n)` is the sum of
    all rewards collected over the time steps between `t+1` and `t+n`. The `n`-step can
    be chosen freely when sampling and defaults to `1`. If `n_step` is a tuple it is
    sampled uniformly across the interval defined by the tuple (for each row in the
    batch).

    Each episode contains - in addition to the data tuples presented above - two further
    elements in its ` extra_model_outputs`, namely `n_steps` and `weights`. The former
    holds the `n_step` used for the sampled timesteps in the episode and the latter the
    corresponding (importance sampling) weight for the transition.

    After sampling priorities can be updated (for the last sampled episode list) with
    `self.update_priorities`. This method assigns the new priorities automatically to
    the last sampled timesteps. Note, this implies that sampling timesteps and updating
    their corresponding priorities needs to alternate (e.g. sampling several times and
    then updating the priorities would not work because the buffer caches the last
    sampled timestep indices).

        This sampling method also adds (importance sampling) weights to
        the returned batch. See for prioritized sampling Schaul et al.
        (2016).

        Each sampled item defines a transition of the form:

        `(o_t, a_t, sum(r_(t+1:t+n+1)), o_(t+n), terminated_(t+n), truncated_(t+n))`

        where `o_(t+n)` is drawn by prioritized sampling, i.e. the priority
        of `o_(t+n)` led to the sample and defines the importance weight that
        is returned in the sample batch. `n` is defined by the `n_step` applied.

        If requested, `info`s of a transitions last timestep `t+n` are added to
        the batch.

        Args:
            num_items: Number of items (transitions) to sample from this

            batch_length_T: THe sequence length to sample. At this point in time
                only sequences of length 1 are possible.
            n_step: The n-step to apply. For the default the batch contains in
                `"new_obs"` the observation and in `"obs"` the observation `n`
                time steps before. The reward will be the sum of rewards
                collected in between these two observations and the action will
                be the one executed n steps before such that we always have the
                state-action pair that triggered the rewards.
                If `n_step` is a tuple, it is considered as a range to sample
                from. If `None`, we use `n_step=1`.
            beta: The exponent of the importance sampling weight (see Schaul et
                al. (2016)). A `beta=0.0` does not correct for the bias introduced
                by prioritized replay and `beta=1.0` fully corrects for it.
            gamma: The discount factor to be used when applying n-step calculations.
                The default of `0.99` should be replaced by the `Algorithm`s
                discount factor.
            include_infos: A boolean indicating, if `info`s should be included in
                the batch. This could be of advantage, if the `info` contains
                values from the environment important for loss computation. If
                `True`, the info at the `"new_obs"` in the batch is included.
            include_extra_model_outputs: A boolean indicating, if
                `extra_model_outputs` should be included in the batch. This could be
                of advantage, if the `extra_mdoel_outputs`  contain outputs from the
                model important for loss computation and only able to compute with the
                actual state of model e.g. action log-probabilities, etc.). If `True`,
                the extra model outputs at the `"obs"` in the batch is included (the
                timestep at which the action is computed).

        Returns:
