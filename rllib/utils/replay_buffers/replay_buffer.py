    This class implements a basic ring-type of buffer with random sampling.
    ReplayBuffer is the base class for advanced types that add functionality while
    retaining compatibility through inheritance.

    and capacities. This behaviour is generally similar for other buffers, although
    they might not implement all storage_units.
