    """A Stats object that tracks the mean of a series of values.

    Note the following limitation: When merging multiple MeanStats objects, the resulting mean is not the true mean of all values.
    Instead, it is the mean of the means of the incoming MeanStats objects.
    This is because we calculate the mean in parallel components and potentially merge them multiple times in one reduce cycle.
    The resulting mean of means may differ significantly from the true mean, especially if some incoming means are the result of few outliers.

    Example to illustrate this limitation:
    First incoming mean: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> 3
    Second incoming mean: [15] -> 15
    Mean of both merged means: [3, 15] -> 9
    True mean of all values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15] -> 5
