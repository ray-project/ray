    """A generic class collecting and processing metrics in RL training and evaluation.

    This class represents the main API used by all of RLlib's components (internal and
    user facing) in order to log, collect, and process (reduce) stats during training
    and evaluation/inference.

    It supports:
    - Logging of simple float/int values (for example a loss) over time or from
    parallel runs (n Learner workers, each one reporting a loss from their respective
    data shard).
    - Logging of images, videos, or other more complex data structures over time.
    - Reducing these collected values using a user specified reduction method (for
    example "min" or "mean") and other settings controlling the reduction and internal
    data, such as sliding windows or EMA coefficients.
    - Resetting the logged values after a `reduce()` call in order to make space for
    new values to be logged.
