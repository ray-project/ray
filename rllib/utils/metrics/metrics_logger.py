class MetricsLogger:
    """A generic class collecting and processing metrics in RL training and evaluation.

    This class represents the main API used by all of RLlib's components (internal and
    user facing) in order to log, collect, and process (reduce) stats during training
    and evaluation/inference.

    It supports:
    - Logging of simple float/int values (for example a loss) over time or from
    parallel runs (n Learner workers, each one reporting a loss from their respective
    data shard).
    - Logging of images, videos, or other more complex data structures over time.
    - Reducing these collected values using a user specified reduction method (for
    example "min" or "mean") and other settings controlling the reduction and internal
    data, such as sliding windows or EMA coefficients.
    - Optionally clearing all logged values after a `reduce()` call to make space for
    new data.

                `clear_on_reduce=False` metrics (aka. "lifetime counts"). The `Stats`

                estimate. The current throughput estimate of a key can be obtained

            })

        Args:
            stats_dict: The (possibly nested) dict with `Stats` or individual values as
                leafs to be logged to this logger.
            key: An additional key (or tuple of keys) to prepend to all the keys
                (or tuples of keys in case of nesting) found inside `stats_dict`.
                Useful to log the entire contents of `stats_dict` in a more organized
                fashion under one new key, for example logging the results returned by
                an EnvRunner under key
            reduce: The reduction method to apply, once `self.reduce()` is called.
                If None, will collect all logged values under `key` in a list (and
                also return that list upon calling `self.reduce()`).
            window: An optional window size to reduce over.
                If not None, then the reduction operation is only applied to the most
                recent `window` items, and - after reduction - the internal values list
                under `key` is shortened to hold at most `window` items (the most
                recent ones).
                Must be None if `ema_coeff` is provided.
                If None (and `ema_coeff` is None), reduction must not be "mean".
            ema_coeff: An optional EMA coefficient to use if `reduce` is "mean"
                and no `window` is provided. Note that if both `window` and `ema_coeff`
                are provided, an error is thrown. Also, if `ema_coeff` is provided,
                `reduce` must be "mean".
                The reduction formula for EMA is:
                EMA(t1) = (1.0 - ema_coeff) * EMA(t0) + ema_coeff * new_value
            clear_on_reduce: If True, all values under `key` will be emptied after
                `self.reduce()` is called. Setting this to True is useful for cases,
                in which the internal values list would otherwise grow indefinitely,
                for example if reduce is None and there is no `window` provided.
            with_throughput: Whether to track a throughput estimate together with this
                metric. This is only supported for `reduce=sum` and
                `clear_on_reduce=False` metrics (aka. "lifetime counts"). The `Stats`
                object under the logged key then keeps track of the time passed
                between two consecutive calls to `reduce()` and update its throughput
                estimate. The current throughput estimate of a key can be obtained
                through: <MetricsLogger>.peek(key, throughput=True).
            throughput_ema_coeff: The EMA coefficient to use for throughput tracking.
                Only used if with_throughput=True. Defaults to 0.05 if with_throughput is True.
