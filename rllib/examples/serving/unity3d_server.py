"""
Example of running a Unity3D (MLAgents) Policy server that can learn
Policies via sampling inside many connected Unity game clients (possibly
running in the cloud on n nodes).
For a locally running Unity3D example, see:
`examples/unity3d_env_local.py`

To run this script against one or more possibly cloud-based clients:
1) Install Unity3D and `pip install mlagents`.

2) Compile a Unity3D example game with MLAgents support (e.g. 3DBall or any
   other one that you created yourself) and place the compiled binary
   somewhere, where your RLlib client script (see below) can access it.

2.1) To find Unity3D MLAgent examples, first `pip install mlagents`,
     then check out the `.../ml-agents/Project/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/`
     folder.

3) Change this RLlib Policy server code so it knows the observation- and
   action Spaces, the different Policies (called "behaviors" in Unity3D
   MLAgents), and Agent-to-Policy mappings for your particular game.
   Alternatively, use one of the two already existing setups (3DBall or
   SoccerStrikersVsGoalie).

4) Then run (two separate shells/machines):
$ python unity3d_server.py --env 3DBall
$ python unity3d_client.py --inference-mode=local --game [path to game binary]
