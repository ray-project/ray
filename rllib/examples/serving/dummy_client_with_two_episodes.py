"""
For testing purposes only.
Runs a policy client that starts two episodes, uses one for calculating actions
("action episode") and the other for logging those actions ("logging episode").
Terminates the "logging episode" before computing a few more actions
from the "action episode".
The action episode is also started with the training_enabled=False flag so no
batches should be produced by this episode for training inside the
SampleCollector's `postprocess_trajectory` method.
