"""
Example of running an external simulator (a simple CartPole env
in this case) against an RLlib policy server listening on one or more
HTTP-speaking port(s). See `cartpole_server.py` in this same directory for
how to start this server.

This script will only create one single env altogether to illustrate
that RLlib can run w/o needing an internalized environment.

Setup:
1) Start the policy server:
    See `cartpole_server.py` on how to do this.
2) Run this client:
    $ python cartpole_client.py --inference-mode=local|remote --[other options]
      Use --help for help.

In "local" inference-mode, the action computations are performed
inside the PolicyClient used in this script w/o sending an HTTP request
to the server. This reduces network communication overhead, but requires
the PolicyClient to create its own RolloutWorker (+Policy) based on
the server's config. The PolicyClient will retrieve this config automatically.
You do not need to define the RLlib config dict here!

In "remote" inference mode, the PolicyClient will send action requests to the
server and not compute its own actions locally. The server then performs the
inference forward pass and returns the action to the client.

In either case, the user of PolicyClient must:
- Declare new episodes and finished episodes to the PolicyClient.
- Log rewards to the PolicyClient.
- Call `get_action` to receive an action from the PolicyClient (whether it'd be
  computed locally or remotely).
- Besides `get_action`, the user may let the PolicyClient know about
  off-policy actions having been taken via `log_action`. This can be used in
  combination with `get_action`, but will only work, if the connected server
  runs an off-policy RL algorithm (such as DQN, SAC, or DDPG).
