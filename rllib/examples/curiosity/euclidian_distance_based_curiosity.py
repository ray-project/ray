"""Example of a euclidian-distance curiosity mechanism to learn in sparse-rewards envs.

This example:
    - demonstrates how to define your own euclidian-distance-based curiosity ConnectorV2
    piece that computes intrinsic rewards based on the delta between incoming
    observations and some set of already stored (prior) observations. Thereby, the
    further away the incoming observation is from the already stored ones, the higher
    its corresponding intrinsic reward.
    - shows how this connector piece adds the intrinsic reward to the corresponding
    "main" (extrinsic) reward and overrides the value in the "rewards" key in the
    episode. It thus demonstrates how to do reward shaping in general with RLlib.
    - shows how to plug this connector piece into your algorithm's config.
    - uses Tune and RLlib to learn the env described above and compares 2
    algorithms, one that does use curiosity vs one that does not.

We use the MountainCar-v0 environment, a sparse-reward env that is very hard to learn
for a regular PPO algorithm.


How to run this script
----------------------
`python [script file name].py --enable-new-api-stack`

Use the `--no-curiosity` flag to disable curiosity learning and force your policy
to be trained on the task w/o the use of intrinsic rewards. With this option, the
algorithm should NOT succeed.

For debugging, use the following additional command line options
`--no-tune --num-env-runners=0`
which should allow you to set breakpoints anywhere in the RLlib code and
have the execution stop there for inspection and debugging.

For logging to your WandB account, use:
`--wandb-key=[your WandB API key] --wandb-project=[some project name]
--wandb-run-name=[optional: WandB run name (within the defined project)]`


Results to expect
-----------------
In the console output, you can see that only a PPO policy that uses curiosity can
actually learn.

Policy using count-based curiosity:
