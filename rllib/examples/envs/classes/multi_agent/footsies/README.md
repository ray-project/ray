# Footsies Environment

This environment implementation is based on the [FootsiesGym project](https://github.com/chasemcd/FootsiesGym),
specifically the version as of **July 28, 2025**.

## Notes

All examples in the RLlib documentation that use the Footsies environment are self-contained.
This means that you do not need to install anything from the FootsiesGym repository or other places.
Examples handle binary automatically (downloading, extracting, starting, stopping, etc.).
