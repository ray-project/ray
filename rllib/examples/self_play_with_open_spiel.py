"""Example showing how one can implement a simple self-play training workflow.

Uses the open spiel adapter of RLlib with the "connect_four" game and
a multi-agent setup with a "main" policy and n "main_v[x]" policies
(x=version number), which are all at-some-point-frozen copies of
"main". At the very beginning, "main" plays against RandomPolicy.

Checks for the training progress after each training update via a custom
callback. We simply measure the win rate of "main" vs the opponent
("main_v[x]" or RandomPolicy at the beginning) by looking through the
achieved rewards in the episodes in the train batch. If this win rate
reaches some configurable threshold, we add a new policy to
the policy map (a frozen copy of the current "main" one) and change the
policy_mapping_fn to make new matches of "main" vs any of the previous
versions of "main" (including the just added one).

After training for n iterations, a configurable number of episodes can
be played by the user against the "main" agent on the command line.
