[core] Replace SHA-1 with SHA-256 for internal hash operations

This commit addresses security concerns by migrating all internal
hash operations from SHA-1 to SHA-256 across the Ray codebase.

Changes:
- Runtime environment hashing (pip, conda, uv, packaging)
- Autoscaler configuration hashing (launch, runtime, SSH)
- AWS CloudWatch helper hash operations
- Service hashing (Serve, Data, AIR, Tune, Collective)
- Function manager collision detection
- Test fixtures and examples

Impact:
- Hash outputs change from 40-char to 64-char hex strings
- Cache invalidation expected for runtime environments
- Improved security and FIPS compliance readiness
- No functional changes to core behavior

Fixes #53435
