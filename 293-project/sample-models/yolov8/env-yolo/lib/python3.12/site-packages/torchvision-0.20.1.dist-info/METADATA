The torchvision package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer
vision.

## Installation

Please refer to the [official
instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the stable
versions of `torch` and `torchvision` on your system.

To build source, refer to our [contributing
page](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-installation).

The following is the corresponding `torchvision` versions and supported Python
versions.

## Image Backends

Torchvision currently supports the following image backends:

- torch tensors
- PIL images:
    - [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
    - [Pillow-SIMD](https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd) - a **much faster** drop-in replacement for Pillow with SIMD.

Read more in in our [docs](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html).

## [UNSTABLE] Video Backend

Torchvision currently supports the following video backends:

- [pyav](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) (default) - Pythonic binding for ffmpeg libraries.
- video_reader - This needs ffmpeg to be installed and torchvision to be built from source. There shouldn't be any
  conflicting version of ffmpeg installed. Currently, this is only supported on Linux.

```
conda install -c conda-forge 'ffmpeg<4.3'
python setup.py install
```

# Using the models on C++

Refer to [example/cpp](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/examples/cpp).

**DISCLAIMER**: the `libtorchvision` library includes the torchvision
custom ops as well as most of the C++ torchvision APIs. Those APIs do not come
with any backward-compatibility guarantees and may change from one version to
the next. Only the Python APIs are stable and with backward-compatibility
guarantees. So, if you need stability within a C++ environment, your best bet is
to export the Python APIs via torchscript.

## Documentation

You can find the API documentation on the pytorch website: <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html>

If you're a dataset owner and wish to update any part of it (description, citation, etc.), or do not want your dataset
to be included in this library, please get in touch through a GitHub issue. Thanks for your contribution to the ML
community!

## Pre-trained Model License

The pre-trained models provided in this library may have their own licenses or terms and conditions derived from the
