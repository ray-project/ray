class ToTensor:

    Converts an image from a numpy array to a PyTorch tensor.

    This class is designed to be part of a transformation pipeline, e.g., T.Compose([LetterBox(size), ToTensor()]).

    Attributes:
        half (bool): If True, converts the image to half precision (float16).

    Methods:
        __call__: Applies the tensor conversion to an input image.

    Examples:
        >>> transform = ToTensor(half=True)
        >>> img = np.random.randint(0, 255, (640, 640, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

    Notes:
        The input image is expected to be in BGR format with shape (H, W, C).
        The output tensor will be in RGB format with shape (C, H, W), normalized to [0, 1].
