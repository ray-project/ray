class BOTrack(STrack):
    """
    An extended version of the STrack class for YOLOv8, adding object tracking features.

    This class extends the STrack class to include additional functionalities for object tracking, such as feature
    smoothing, Kalman filter prediction, and reactivation of tracks.

    Attributes:
        shared_kalman (KalmanFilterXYWH): A shared Kalman filter for all instances of BOTrack.
        smooth_feat (np.ndarray): Smoothed feature vector.
        curr_feat (np.ndarray): Current feature vector.
        features (deque): A deque to store feature vectors with a maximum length defined by `feat_history`.
        alpha (float): Smoothing factor for the exponential moving average of features.
        mean (np.ndarray): The mean state of the Kalman filter.
        covariance (np.ndarray): The covariance matrix of the Kalman filter.

    Methods:
        update_features(feat): Update features vector and smooth it using exponential moving average.
        predict(): Predicts the mean and covariance using Kalman filter.
        re_activate(new_track, frame_id, new_id): Reactivates a track with updated features and optionally new ID.
        update(new_track, frame_id): Update the YOLOv8 instance with new track and frame ID.
        tlwh: Property that gets the current position in tlwh format `(top left x, top left y, width, height)`.
        multi_predict(stracks): Predicts the mean and covariance of multiple object tracks using shared Kalman filter.
        convert_coords(tlwh): Converts tlwh bounding box coordinates to xywh format.
        tlwh_to_xywh(tlwh): Convert bounding box to xywh format `(center x, center y, width, height)`.

    Examples:
        Create a BOTrack instance and update its features
        >>> bo_track = BOTrack(tlwh=[100, 50, 80, 40], score=0.9, cls=1, feat=np.random.rand(128))
