    This class provides a common interface for various operations related to YOLO models, such as training,
    validation, prediction, exporting, and benchmarking. It handles different types of models, including those
    loaded from local files, Ultralytics HUB, or Triton Server.

        callbacks (Dict): A dictionary of callback functions for various events during model operations.
        predictor (BasePredictor): The predictor object used for making predictions.
        model (nn.Module): The underlying PyTorch model.

        cfg (str): The configuration of the model if loaded from a *.yaml file.
        ckpt_path (str): The path to the checkpoint file.
        overrides (Dict): A dictionary of overrides for model configuration.
        metrics (Dict): The latest training/validation metrics.
        session (HUBTrainingSession): The Ultralytics HUB session, if applicable.
        task (str): The type of task the model is intended for.
        model_name (str): The name of the model.
