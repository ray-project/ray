    Enumeration class representing the possible states of an object being tracked.

        Tracked (int): State when the object is successfully tracked in subsequent frames.
        Lost (int): State when the object is no longer tracked.
        Removed (int): State when the object is removed from tracking.

    Examples:

class BaseTrack:
    """
    Base class for object tracking, providing foundational attributes and methods.

    Attributes:
        _count (int): Class-level counter for unique track IDs.
        track_id (int): Unique identifier for the track.
        is_activated (bool): Flag indicating whether the track is currently active.
        state (TrackState): Current state of the track.
        history (OrderedDict): Ordered history of the track's states.
        features (List): List of features extracted from the object for tracking.
        curr_feature (Any): The current feature of the object being tracked.
        score (float): The confidence score of the tracking.
        start_frame (int): The frame number where tracking started.
        frame_id (int): The most recent frame ID processed by the track.
        time_since_update (int): Frames passed since the last update.
        location (Tuple): The location of the object in the context of multi-camera tracking.

    Methods:
        end_frame: Returns the ID of the last frame where the object was tracked.
        next_id: Increments and returns the next global track ID.
        activate: Abstract method to activate the track.
        predict: Abstract method to predict the next state of the track.
        update: Abstract method to update the track with new data.
        mark_lost: Marks the track as lost.
        mark_removed: Marks the track as removed.
        reset_id: Resets the global track ID counter.

    Examples:
        Initialize a new track and mark it as lost:
        >>> track = BaseTrack()
