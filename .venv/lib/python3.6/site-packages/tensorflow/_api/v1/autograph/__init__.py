"""Conversion of plain Python into TensorFlow graph code.

NOTE: In TensorFlow 2.0, AutoGraph is automatically applied when using
`tf.function`. This module contains lower-level APIs for advanced use.

For more information, see the
[AutoGraph guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autograph).

By equivalent graph code we mean code that generates a TensorFlow graph when
run. The generated graph has the same effects as the original code when executed
(for example with `tf.function` or `tf.compat.v1.Session.run`). In other words,
using AutoGraph can be thought of as running Python in TensorFlow.
