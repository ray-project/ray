"""Bookkeeping overhead (1 node, 10k trials)

In this run, we will start a large number of trials (10k) that take just a
second to run. We thus measure overhead that comes with dealing with a
large number of trials, e.g. experiment checkpointing.

Cluster: cluster_1x16.yaml

Test owner: krfricke

Acceptance criteria: Should run faster than 800 seconds.

Theoretical minimum time: 10000/16 = 625 seconds
