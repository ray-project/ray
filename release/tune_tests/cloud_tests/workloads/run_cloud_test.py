"""Run cloud checkpointing tests.

This script provides utilities and end to end tests for cloud checkpointing.

We are considering several scenarios depending on the combination of the
following Tune properties:

syncer ("auto" or None)
upload_dir

Generally the flow is as follows:

A Tune run is started in a separate process. It is terminated after some
time. It is then restarted for another period of time.

Depending on the combination of the run properties above, we expect different
results between the two runs and after the second run.

For instance, we sometimes expect all checkpoints to be synced to the driver
(syncer="auto" and no upload dir), and sometimes not (syncer=None).

We also ensure that checkpoints are properly deleted.

The Tune run is kicked off in _tune_script.py. Trials write a checkpoint
every 2 iterations, and take 5 seconds per iteration.

More details on the expected results can be found in the scenario descriptions.
