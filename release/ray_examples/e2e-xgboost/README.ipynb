    "This tutorial implements an end-to-end XGBoost application on Anyscale, covering:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed data preprocessing and model training**: Ingest and preprocess data at scale using [Ray Data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data.html). Then, train a distributed [XGBoost model](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/index.html) using [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html) ([`notebooks/01-Distributed_Training.ipynb`](https://github.com/anyscale/e2e-xgboost/blob/main/notebooks/01-Distributed_Training.ipynb))\n",
    "- **Model Validation using Offline Inference**: Evaluate the model using Ray Data offline batch inference ([`notebooks/02-Validation.ipynb`](https://github.com/anyscale/e2e-xgboost/blob/main/notebooks/02-Validation.ipynb)).\n",
    "- **Online Model Serving**: Deploy the model as a scalable online service using [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) ([`notebooks/03-Serving.ipynb`](https://github.com/anyscale/e2e-xgboost/blob/main/notebooks/03-Serving.ipynb)).\n",
    "- **Production workflows**: Create production batch [**Jobs**](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs/) for offline workloads (data prep, training, batch prediction) and potentially online [**Services**](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "Install the dependencies using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "# For development only, install the dev dependencies:\n",
    "# pip install -r requirements_dev.txt\n",
    "# Install the dist_xgboost package\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this tutorial requires ray>=2.44.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyscale Workspaces enable development without thinking about infrastructure, just like one would on a laptop. Workspaces come with:\n",
    "- **Development tools**: Spin up a remote session from your local IDE (cursor, VS Code, etc.) and start coding, using the same tools you love but with the power of Anyscale's compute.\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Continue to install dependencies using familiar tools like pip. Anyscale ensures it propagates dependencies to your cluster.\n",
    "- **Scalable Compute**: Leverage any reserved instance capacity, spot instance from any compute provider of your choice by deploying Anyscale into your account. Alternatively, you can use the Anyscale cloud for a full server-less experience.\n",
    "  - Under the hood, Anyscale spins up and smartly manages a cluster.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Leverage a [distributed debugger](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/workspaces-debugging/#distributed-debugger) to get the same VS Code-like debugging experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about Anyscale Workspaces through the [official documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/workspaces/).\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production\n",
    "Seamlessly integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines by leveraging the Anyscale [CLI](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-cli) or [SDK](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/quickstart-sdk) to deploy [highly available services](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services) and run [reliable batch jobs](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/jobs). Given development occurs in an environment that's almost identical to production (multi-node cluster), this should drastically speed up the development ‚Üí production velocity. Also learn about proprietary RayTurbo features to optimize workloads for performance, fault tolerance, scale, and observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## No infrastructure headaches\n",
    "Abstract away infrastructure from ML/AI developers so they can focus on core ML development. You can additionally better manage compute resources and costs with Anyscale's [enterprise governance and observability](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/enterprise-governance-observability) and [administrator capabilities](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/overview) so you can set [resource quotas](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/resource-quotas/), set [priorities for different workloads](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/global-resource-scheduler) and gain [observability of utilization across your entire compute fleet](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/resource-management/telescope-dashboard).\n",
    "If you're already on a Kubernetes cloud (EKS, GKE, etc.), then you can still leverage the proprietary optimizations from RayTubo you see in action in these tutorials through the [Anyscale K8s Operator](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/kubernetes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of infrastructure headaches Anyscale removes so you can focus on ML development.üëá\n",

    "  <summary>Click <b>here</b> to see the infrastructure pains Anyscale removes</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**üöÄ 1. Fast Workload Launch** (No Cluster Setup Required)\n",
    "* With Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), you must manually create a cluster before launching anything.\n",
    "* This includes setting up Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, node pools, autoscaling, etc.\n",
    "* Anyscale handles all of this automatically‚Äîyou just define your job or endpoint and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚öôÔ∏è 2. No GPU Driver Hassles**\n",
    "* Kubernetes requires you to install and manage NVIDIA drivers and the device plugin for GPU workloads.\n",
    "* On Anyscale, GPU environments just work‚Äîdrivers, libraries, and runtime are pre-configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üì¶ 3. No KubeRay or CRD Management**\n",
    "* Running Ray on K8s needs:\n",
    "    * Installing KubeRay\n",
    "    * Writing and maintaining custom YAML manifests\n",
    "    * Managing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)\n",
    "    * Tuning stateful sets and pod configurations\n",
    "* On Anyscale, this is all abstracted‚Äîyou launch Ray clusters without writing a single YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üß† 4. No Need to Learn K8s Internals**\n",
    "* With Kubernetes, users must:\n",
    "    * Inspect pods/logs\n",
    "    * Navigate dashboards\n",
    "    * Manually send http requests to Ray endpoints\n",
    "* Anyscale users never touch pods. Everything is accessible using the CLI, SDK, or UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üí∏ 5. Spot Instance Handling Just Works**\n",
    "* Kubernetes requires custom node pools and lifecycle handling for spot instance preemptions.\n",
    "* Anyscale handles preemptible Virtual Machines (VMs) automatically with node draining and rescheduling.\n",
