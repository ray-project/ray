"""Fault tolerance test (small cluster, elastic training)

In this run, two training actors will die after some time. It is expected that
in both cases xgboost_ray stops training, but continues right away with the
remaining three actors. Shortly after, the actors will be restarted and
re-integrated into the training loop. Training should finish with all four
actors.

Test owner: krfricke

Acceptance criteria: Should run through and report final results. Intermediate
output should show that training continues with fewer actors when an
actor died. The test will fail if elastic training didn't work.

Notes: This test seems to be somewhat flaky. This might be due to
race conditions in handling dead actors. This is likely a problem of
the xgboost_ray implementation and not of this test.
