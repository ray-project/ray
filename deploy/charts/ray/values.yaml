# operatorImage - For best stability, it's currently recommended to use the nightly ray image in the operator Deployment.
# For the latest ray release version, you can use rayproject/ray:1.3.0
# You could also use a specific master commit, e.g. rayproject/ray:38b64e
# The nightly operator image is compatible with all Ray versions since 1.2.0
