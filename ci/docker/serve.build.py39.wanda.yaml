# This is a clone and python3.9 version of ci/docker/serve.build.wanda.yaml. The latter 
# one is a multi-py version. This file exists due to the historical reason that Ray 
# CI only supports one python version which is python 3.9.
#
# TODO(can-anyscale): migrate all jobs to use the multi-py version
