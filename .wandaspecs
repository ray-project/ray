# Wanda spec discovery configuration.
#
# Lists directories (relative to this file) to scan for .wanda.yaml specs.
# When a spec depends on an image with default prefix cr.ray.io/rayproject/,
# wanda looks for a matching local spec by name and builds it instead of pulling.
#
# Note: In CI mode (-rayci), dependencies are NOT rebuilt - they are assumed
# to have been built by prior pipeline steps and are pulled from the work repo.
