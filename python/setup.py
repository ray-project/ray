# This used to be the first line of the run method in the build_ext class.
# However, we moved it here because the previous approach seemed to fail in
# Docker. Inside of the build.sh script, we install the pyarrow Python module.
# Something about calling "python setup.py install" inside of the build_ext
# run method doesn't work (this is easily reproducible in Docker with just a
# couple files to simulate two Python modules). The problem is that the pyarrow
# module doesn't get added to the easy-install.pth file, so it never gets added
# to the Python path even though the package is built and copied to the right
# location. An alternative fix would be to manually modify the easy-install.pth
# file. TODO(rkn): Fix all of this.
