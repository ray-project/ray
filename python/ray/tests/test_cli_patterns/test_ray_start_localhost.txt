Local node IP: .+

--------------------
Ray runtime started.
--------------------

Next steps
  To connect to this Ray runtime from another node, run
    ray start --address='.+'
  This Ray runtime only accepts connections from local host.
  To accept connections from remote hosts, specify a public ip when starting
  the head node: ray start --head --node-ip-address=<public-ip>.

  Alternatively, use the following Python code:
    import ray
    ray\.init\(address='auto'\)

  To connect to this Ray runtime from outside of the cluster, for example to
  connect to a remote cluster from your laptop directly, use the following
  Python code:
    import ray
    ray\.init\(address='ray://.*'\)

  To see the status of the cluster, use
    ray status
  To monitor and debug Ray, view the dashboard at 
    127.0.0.1:8265

  If connection fails, check your firewall settings and network configuration.

  To terminate the Ray runtime, run
    ray stop
