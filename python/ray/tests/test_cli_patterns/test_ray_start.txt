Next steps
  To connect to this Ray runtime from another node, run
    ray start --address='.+' --redis-password='.+'

  Alternatively, use the following Python code:
    import ray
    ray\.init\(address='auto', _redis_password='.+'\)

  To connect to this Ray runtime from outside of the cluster, for example to
  connect to a remote cluster from your laptop directly, use the following
  Python code:
    import ray
    ray\.init\(address='ray://.*'\)

  If connection fails, check your firewall settings and network configuration.

  To terminate the Ray runtime, run
    ray stop
