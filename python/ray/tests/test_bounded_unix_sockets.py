"""
Detects number of sockets created by Core Workers.

We need exact 2 unix sockets to Raylet: one for `raylet` and one for `plasma_store`.
Example:

    pconn(fd=31, family=<AddressFamily.AF_UNIX: 1>, type=<SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM: 1>, laddr='', raddr='/tmp/ray/session_2023-11-14_13-21-21_747315_27107/sockets/raylet', status='NONE'),  # noqa: E501
    pconn(fd=78, family=<AddressFamily.AF_UNIX: 1>, type=<SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM: 1>, laddr='', raddr='/tmp/ray/session_2023-11-14_13-21-21_747315_27107/sockets/plasma_store', status='NONE')  # noqa: E501

However it's a long overdue bug that we never closed FDs on raylet's fork to create core
workers, making each core worker end up with O(N^2) open sockets. This test ensures this is fixed.

However it's not that easy:

- We can't determine Ray sockets by name: in Linux, it does not show the address as in
    pconn.raddr, so we don't have a way to make sure it's the socket we are asserting.
- We can't assert that len(all_sockets) == 2, because in MacOS, there are some
    system-created sockets like '/var/run/mDNSResponder'.

So we do it good old way (see python/ray/tests/test_actor_bounded_threads.py), test that
number of sockets do not grow as time goes, across workers.
