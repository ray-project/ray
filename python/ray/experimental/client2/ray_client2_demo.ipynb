    "This new client aim to solve these pain points on the existing Ray Client:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's huge: `ray/util/client` has more than 20,000 lines of code, with more lines scattered elsewhere\n",
    "- It's intrusive: all supported Ray APIs has a `@client_mode_hook` and presents in stacktrace\n",
    "- (By default) it breaks when the connection breaks, bringing down all running tasks\n",
    "- Version skew: things silently go down when you use a library with different version on client/server.\n",
    "\n",
    "while still keep these merits of the old Client:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Familiar API: Same `@ray.remote` as in job code\n"
