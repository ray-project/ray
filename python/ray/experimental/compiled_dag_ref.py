    This is a subclass of ObjectRef and resembles ObjectRef in the

    can be called on it to retrieve result. However, there are several
    major differences:
    1. ray.get() can only be called once on CompiledDAGRef.
    2. ray.wait() is not supported.
    3. CompiledDAGRef cannot be copied, deep copied, or pickled.
    4. CompiledDAGRef cannot be passed as an argument to another task.
