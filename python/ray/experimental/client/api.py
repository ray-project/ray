# This file defines an interface and client-side API stub
# for referring either to the core Ray API or the same interface
# from the Ray client.
#
# In tandem with __init__.py, we want to expose an API that's
# close to `python/ray/__init__.py` but with more than one implementation.
# The stubs in __init__ should call into a well-defined interface.
# Only the core Ray API implementation should actually `import ray`
# (and thus import all the raylet worker C bindings and such).
# But to make sure that we're matching these calls, we define this API.
