# Along with `api.py` this is the stub that interfaces with
# the real (C-binding, raylet) ray core.
#
# Ideally, the first import line is the only time we actually
# import ray in this library (excluding the main function for the server)
#
# While the stub is trivial, it allows us to check that the calls we're
# making into the core-ray module are contained and well-defined.
