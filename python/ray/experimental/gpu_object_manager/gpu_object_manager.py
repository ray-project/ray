    Wait for the tensor to be freed.

    This function is useful for cases where an actor keeps a reference to a
    tensor after returning the tensor from a task annotated with
    `@ray.method(tensor_transport=...)`. In this case, Ray will store a
    *reference* to the tensor, so any in-place modifications made by the actor
    that returned the tensor could be seen by other actors. See
    :ref:`Ray Direct Transport (RDT) <direct-transport>` for more details.

    Call this function for RDT objects to ensure that all corresponding
    `ray.ObjectRefs` have gone out of scope and therefore the tensor is safe to
    write to again.

    Args:
        tensor: The tensor to wait to be freed. This should be a tensor that was
            previously returned by a task annotated with
            `@ray.method(tensor_transport=...)` or stored via
            `ray.put(_tensor_transport="...")`.
        timeout: The timeout in seconds to wait for all references to the tensor
            to go out of scope. Set to None to wait indefinitely. Note that if
            None is used, this function could hang if the `ray.ObjectRefs` that
            refer to this tensor never go out of scope.
