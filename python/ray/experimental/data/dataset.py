    Datasets are implemented as a list of ``ObjectRef[Block[T]]``. The block
    also determines the unit of parallelism. The default block type is the
    ``ArrowBlock``, which is backed by a ``pyarrow.Table`` object. Other
    Python objects are represented with ``SimpleBlock`` (a plain Python list).

    Since Datasets are just lists of Ray object refs, they can be passed
    between Ray tasks and actors just like any other object. Datasets support
    conversion to/from several more featureful dataframe libraries
    (e.g., Spark, Dask, Modin, MARS), and are also compatible with distributed
    TensorFlow / PyTorch.

    Dataset supports parallel transformations such as .map(), .map_batches(),
    and simple repartition, but currently not aggregations and joins.
