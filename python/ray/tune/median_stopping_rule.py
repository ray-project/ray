        time_attr (str): The training result attr to use for comparing time.
            Note that you can pass in something non-temporal such as
            `training_iteration` as a measure of progress, the only requirement
            is that the attribute should increase monotonically.
        reward_attr (str): The training result objective value attribute. As
            with `time_attr`, this may refer to any objective value that
            is supposed to increase with time.
        grace_period (float): Only stop trials at least this old in time.
            The units are the same as the attribute named by `time_attr`.
        min_samples_required (int): Min samples to compute median over.
        hard_stop (bool): If False, pauses trials instead of stopping
            them. When all other trials are complete, paused trials will be
            resumed and allowed to run FIFO.
        verbose (bool): If True, will output the median and best result each
            time a trial reports. Defaults to True.
