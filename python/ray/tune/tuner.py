class Tuner:
    """Tuner is the recommended way of launching hyperparameter tuning jobs with Ray Tune.

    Attributes:
        trainable: The trainable to be tuned.
        param_space: Search space of the tuning job.
            One thing to note is that both preprocessor and dataset can be tuned here.
        tune_config: Tuning algorithm specific configs.
            Refer to ray.tune.tune_config.TuneConfig for more info.
        run_config: Runtime configuration that is specific to individual trials.
            Refer to ray.ml.run_config.RunConfig for more info.

    Returns:
        ``ResultGrid`` object.

    Usage pattern:
    .. code-block:: python

        # TODO(xwjiang): Make this runnable. Add imports.
