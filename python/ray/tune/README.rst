Tune: Scalable Hyperparameter Search
====================================

Tune is a scalable framework for hyperparameter search with a focus on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning.

User documentation can be `found here <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html>`__.


Tutorial
--------

To get started with Tune, try going through `our tutorial of using Tune with Keras <https://github.com/ray-project/tutorial/blob/master/tune_exercises/exercise_1_basics.ipynb>`__.

(Experimental): You can try out `the above tutorial on a free hosted server via Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ray-project/tutorial/master?filepath=tune_exercises%2Fexercise_1_basics.ipynb>`__.
