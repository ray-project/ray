    `s` is a value determined by given parameters, and assigned on
    a cyclic basis.

    In each bracket, there are at most `n(s)` trials, indicating that
    `n` is a function of `s`. These trials go through a series of
    halving procedures, dropping lowest performers. Multiple
    brackets are running at once.
