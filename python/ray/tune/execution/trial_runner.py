        while not runner.is_finished():
            runner.step()
            print(runner.debug_string())

    The main job of TrialRunner is scheduling trials to efficiently use cluster
    resources, without overloading the cluster.

    While Ray itself provides resource management for tasks and actors, this is
    not sufficient when scheduling trials that may instantiate multiple actors.
    This is because if insufficient resources are available, concurrent trials
    could deadlock waiting for new resources to become available. Furthermore,
    oversubscribing the cluster could degrade training performance, leading to
    misleading benchmark results.

    Args:
        search_alg: SearchAlgorithm for generating
            Trial objects.
        scheduler: Defaults to FIFOScheduler.
        local_checkpoint_dir: Path where
            global checkpoints are stored and restored from.
        remote_checkpoint_dir: Remote path where
            global checkpoints are stored and restored from. Used
            if `resume` == REMOTE.
        sync_config: See `tune.py:run`.
        stopper: Custom class for stopping whole experiments. See
            ``Stopper``.
        resume: see `tune.py:run`.
        server_port: Port number for launching TuneServer.
        fail_fast: Finishes as soon as a trial fails if True.
            If fail_fast='raise' provided, Tune will automatically
            raise the exception received by the Trainable. fail_fast='raise'
            can easily leak resources and should be used with caution.
        checkpoint_period: Trial runner checkpoint periodicity in
            seconds. Defaults to ``"auto"``, which adjusts checkpointing
            time so that at most 5% of the time is spent on writing
            checkpoints.
        trial_executor: Defaults to RayTrialExecutor.
        callbacks: List of callbacks that will be called at different
            times in the training loop. Must be instances of the
            ``ray.tune.execution.trial_runner.Callback`` class.
        metric: Metric used to check received results. If a result is
            reported without this metric, an error will be raised. The error
            can be omitted by not providing a metric or by setting the env
