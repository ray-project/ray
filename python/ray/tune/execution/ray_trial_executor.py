    ray.remote is a registration call. It sends the serialized object to the

    Later, class.remote() actually creates the remote actor. The
    actor will be instantiated on some arbitrary machine,

    Without this cache, you would register the same serialized object

    this can easily nuke the redis instance (and basically blow up Ray).
    This cache instead allows us to register once and only once.

        Ray Tune caches actors for re-use to avoid initialization overhead. This is
        useful in two situations: a) to avoid scheduling overhead of actors when
        trials run for a short time (e.g. < 1 second), and b) to avoid setup overhead
        when trials initialize a heavy environment/dependencies (e.g. rllib).

        Actors are cached when a trial is stopped. However, at that point in time
        we don't always know if we will need the actor later or not. E.g. if all
        subsequent trials have different resource requirements, we wouldn't need to
        cache the actor.

        Tune will generate a new trial in the next iteration of step(). Only once
        this new trial is generated can we know if we will actually use the cached
        actor soon. This is especially the case when we only run one trial at the time
        and don't allow more pending trials: At the point of caching there would be
        _no_ pending trial, so we would never cache the actor.

        To circumvent this problem, we always cache an actor once the trial is
        gracefully stopped (and when `reuse_actors=True`). We only remove this
        cached actor once we have at least one new staged trial, so that we know
        if we need to keep the actor or not. So if we create a new trial in the next
        iteration, we can either reuse the cached actor (if resources match) or
        remove it (if resources don't match and the cached actor is thus not required).

        This method fetches the required resources for all pending trials and the
        resources for all cached actors. If we cached more actors than we need, we
        terminate the excess actors and free the resources.

        In case there are multiple events available for handling, the next
        event is determined by the following priority:
        1. if there is `next_trial_exists`, and if there is cached resources
        to use, PG_READY is emitted.
        2. if there is `next_trial_exists` and there is no cached resources
        to use, wait on pg future and randomized other futures. If multiple
        futures are ready, pg future will take priority to be handled first.
        3. if there is no `next_trial_exists`, wait on just randomized other
        futures.

        An example of #3 would be synchronous hyperband. Although there are pgs
        ready, the scheduler is holding back scheduling new trials since the
        whole band of trials is waiting for the slowest trial to finish. In
        this case, we prioritize handling training result to avoid deadlock
        situation.

        This is a blocking wait with a timeout (specified with env var).
        The reason for the timeout is
        we still want to print status info periodically in TrialRunner for
        better user experience.

        The handle of `ExecutorEvent.STOP_RESULT` is purely internal to
        RayTrialExecutor itself. All the other future results are handled by
        TrialRunner.

        In the future we may want to do most of the handle of
        `ExecutorEvent.RESTORE_RESULT` and `SAVING_RESULT` in
        RayTrialExecutor itself and only notify TrialRunner to invoke
        corresponding callbacks. This view is more consistent with our goal
        of TrialRunner responsible for external facing Trial state transition,
        while RayTrialExecutor responsible for internal facing transitions,
        namely, `is_saving`, `is_restoring` etc.

        Also you may notice that the boundary between RayTrialExecutor and
        PlacementGroupManager right now is really blurry. This will be
        improved once we move to an ActorPool abstraction.

        `next_trial_exists` means that there is a trial to run - prioritize
        returning PG_READY in this case.
