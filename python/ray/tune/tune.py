    """Executes training.

    Args:
        run_or_experiment (function | class | str | :class:`Experiment`): If
            function|class|str, this is the algorithm or model to train.
            This may refer to the name of a built-on algorithm
            (e.g. RLLib's DQN or PPO), a user-defined trainable
            function or class, or the string identifier of a
            trainable function or class registered in the tune registry.
            If Experiment, then Tune will execute training based on
            Experiment.spec. If you want to pass in a Python lambda, you
            will need to first register the function:
            ``tune.register_trainable("lambda_id", lambda x: ...)``. You can
            then use ``tune.run("lambda_id")``.
        name (str): Name of experiment.
        stop (dict | callable | :class:`Stopper`): Stopping criteria. If dict,
            the keys may be any field in the return result of 'train()',
            whichever is reached first. If function, it must take (trial_id,
            result) as arguments and return a boolean (True if trial should be
            stopped, False otherwise). This can also be a subclass of
            ``ray.tune.Stopper``, which allows users to implement
            custom experiment-wide stopping (i.e., stopping an entire Tune
            run based on some time constraint).
        config (dict): Algorithm-specific configuration for Tune variant
            generation (e.g. env, hyperparams). Defaults to empty dict.
            Custom search algorithms may ignore this.
        resources_per_trial (dict): Machine resources to allocate per trial,
            e.g. ``{"cpu": 64, "gpu": 8}``. Note that GPUs will not be
            assigned unless you specify them here. Defaults to 1 CPU and 0
            GPUs in ``Trainable.default_resource_request()``.
        num_samples (int): Number of times to sample from the
            hyperparameter space. Defaults to 1. If `grid_search` is
            provided as an argument, the grid will be repeated
            `num_samples` of times.
        local_dir (str): Local dir to save training results to.
            Defaults to ``~/ray_results``.
        upload_dir (str): Optional URI to sync training results and checkpoints
            to (e.g. ``s3://bucket`` or ``gs://bucket``).
        trial_name_creator (func): Optional function for generating
            the trial string representation.
        loggers (list): List of logger creators to be used with
            each Trial. If None, defaults to ray.tune.logger.DEFAULT_LOGGERS.
            See `ray/tune/logger.py`.
        log_to_file (bool|str|Sequence): Log stdout and stderr to files in
            Tune's trial directories. If this is `False` (default), no files
            are written. If `true`, outputs are written to `trialdir/stdout`
            and `trialdir/stderr`, respectively. If this is a single string,
            this is interpreted as a file relative to the trialdir, to which
            both streams are written. If this is a Sequence (e.g. a Tuple),
            it has to have length 2 and the elements indicate the files to
            which stdout and stderr are written, respectively.
        sync_to_cloud (func|str): Function for syncing the local_dir to and
            from upload_dir. If string, then it must be a string template that
            includes `{source}` and `{target}` for the syncer to run. If not
            provided, the sync command defaults to standard S3 or gsutil sync
            commands. By default local_dir is synced to remote_dir every 300
            seconds. To change this, set the TUNE_CLOUD_SYNC_S
            environment variable in the driver machine.
        sync_to_driver (func|str|bool): Function for syncing trial logdir from
            remote node to local. If string, then it must be a string template
            that includes `{source}` and `{target}` for the syncer to run.
            If True or not provided, it defaults to using rsync. If False,
            syncing to driver is disabled.
        checkpoint_freq (int): How many training iterations between
            checkpoints. A value of 0 (default) disables checkpointing.
            This has no effect when using the Functional Training API.
        checkpoint_at_end (bool): Whether to checkpoint at the end of the
            experiment regardless of the checkpoint_freq. Default is False.
            This has no effect when using the Functional Training API.
        sync_on_checkpoint (bool): Force sync-down of trial checkpoint to
            driver. If set to False, checkpoint syncing from worker to driver
            is asynchronous and best-effort. This does not affect persistent
            storage syncing. Defaults to True.
        keep_checkpoints_num (int): Number of checkpoints to keep. A value of
            `None` keeps all checkpoints. Defaults to `None`. If set, need
            to provide `checkpoint_score_attr`.
        checkpoint_score_attr (str): Specifies by which attribute to rank the
            best checkpoint. Default is increasing order. If attribute starts
            with `min-` it will rank attribute in decreasing order, i.e.
            `min-validation_loss`.
        global_checkpoint_period (int): Seconds between global checkpointing.
            This does not affect `checkpoint_freq`, which specifies frequency
            for individual trials.
        export_formats (list): List of formats that exported at the end of
            the experiment. Default is None.
        max_failures (int): Try to recover a trial at least this many times.
            Ray will recover from the latest checkpoint if present.
            Setting to -1 will lead to infinite recovery retries.
            Setting to 0 will disable retries. Defaults to 3.
        fail_fast (bool | str): Whether to fail upon the first error.
            If fail_fast='raise' provided, Tune will automatically
            raise the exception received by the Trainable. fail_fast='raise'
            can easily leak resources and should be used with caution (it
            is best used with `ray.init(local_mode=True)`).
        restore (str): Path to checkpoint. Only makes sense to set if
            running 1 trial. Defaults to None.
        search_alg (Searcher): Search algorithm for optimization.
        scheduler (TrialScheduler): Scheduler for executing
            the experiment. Choose among FIFO (default), MedianStopping,
            AsyncHyperBand, HyperBand and PopulationBasedTraining. Refer to
            ray.tune.schedulers for more options.
        with_server (bool): Starts a background Tune server. Needed for
            using the Client API.
        server_port (int): Port number for launching TuneServer.
        verbose (int): 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode. 0 = silent,
            1 = only status updates, 2 = status and trial results.
        progress_reporter (ProgressReporter): Progress reporter for reporting
            intermediate experiment progress. Defaults to CLIReporter if
            running in command-line, or JupyterNotebookReporter if running in
            a Jupyter notebook.
        resume (str|bool): One of "LOCAL", "REMOTE", "PROMPT", or bool.
            LOCAL/True restores the checkpoint from the local_checkpoint_dir.
            REMOTE restores the checkpoint from remote_checkpoint_dir.
            PROMPT provides CLI feedback. False forces a new
            experiment. If resume is set but checkpoint does not exist,
            ValueError will be thrown.
        queue_trials (bool): Whether to queue trials when the cluster does
            not currently have enough resources to launch one. This should
            be set to True when running on an autoscaling cluster to enable
            automatic scale-up.
        reuse_actors (bool): Whether to reuse actors between different trials
            when possible. This can drastically speed up experiments that start
            and stop actors often (e.g., PBT in time-multiplexing mode). This
            requires trials to have the same resource requirements.
        trial_executor (TrialExecutor): Manage the execution of trials.
        raise_on_failed_trial (bool): Raise TuneError if there exists failed
            trial (of ERROR state) when the experiments complete.
        ray_auto_init (bool): Automatically starts a local Ray cluster
            if using a RayTrialExecutor (which is the default) and
            if Ray is not initialized. Defaults to True.



    Returns:
        ExperimentAnalysis: Object for experiment analysis.
