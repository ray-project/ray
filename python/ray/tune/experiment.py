class Experiment(object):
    """Tracks experiment specifications.

    Parameters:
        name (str): Name of experiment.
        run (str): The algorithm or model to train. This may refer to the
            name of a built-on algorithm (e.g. RLLib's DQN or PPO), or a
            user-defined trainable function or class
            registered in the tune registry.
        stop (dict): The stopping criteria. The keys may be any field in
            TrainingResult, whichever is reached first.  Defaults to
            empty dict.
        config (dict): Algorithm-specific configuration
            (e.g. env, hyperparams). Defaults to empty dict.
        resources (dict): Machine resources to allocate per trial,
            e.g. ``{"cpu": 64, "gpu": 8}``. Note that GPUs will not be
            assigned unless you specify them here. Defaults to 1 CPU and 0
            GPUs.
        repeat (int): Number of times to repeat each trial. Defaults to 1.
        local_dir (str): Local dir to save training results to.
            Defaults to ``~/ray_results``.
        upload_dir (str): Optional URI to sync training results
            to (e.g. ``s3://bucket``).
        checkpoint_freq (int): How many training iterations between
            checkpoints. A value of 0 (default) disables checkpointing.
        max_failures (int): Try to recover a trial from its last
            checkpoint at least this many times. Only applies if
            checkpointing is enabled. Defaults to 3.
