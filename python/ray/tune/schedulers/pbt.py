@PublicAPI
class PopulationBasedTraining(FIFOScheduler):
    """Implements the Population Based Training (PBT) algorithm.

    https://www.deepmind.com/blog/population-based-training-of-neural-networks

    PBT trains a group of models (or agents) in parallel. Periodically, poorly
    performing models clone the state of the top performers, and a random
    mutation is applied to their hyperparameters in the hopes of
    outperforming the current top models.

    Unlike other hyperparameter search algorithms, PBT mutates hyperparameters
    during training time. This enables very fast hyperparameter discovery and
    also automatically discovers good annealing schedules.

    This Tune PBT implementation considers all trials added as part of the
    PBT population. If the number of trials exceeds the cluster capacity,
    they will be time-multiplexed as to balance training progress across the
    population. To run multiple trials, use `tune.TuneConfig(num_samples=<int>)`.

    In {LOG_DIR}/{MY_EXPERIMENT_NAME}/, all mutations are logged in
    `pbt_global.txt` and individual policy perturbations are recorded
    in pbt_policy_{i}.txt. Tune logs: [target trial tag, clone trial tag,
    target trial iteration, clone trial iteration, old config, new config]
    on each perturbation step.

    Args:
        time_attr: The training result attr to use for comparing time.
            Note that you can pass in something non-temporal such as
            `training_iteration` as a measure of progress, the only requirement
            is that the attribute should increase monotonically.
        metric: The training result objective value attribute. Stopping
            procedures will use this attribute. If None but a mode was passed,
            the `ray.tune.result.DEFAULT_METRIC` will be used per default.
        mode: One of {min, max}. Determines whether objective is
            minimizing or maximizing the metric attribute.
        perturbation_interval: Models will be considered for
            perturbation at this interval of `time_attr`. Note that
            perturbation incurs checkpoint overhead, so you shouldn't set this
            to be too frequent.
        burn_in_period: Models will not be considered for
            perturbation before this interval of `time_attr` has passed. This
            guarantees that models are trained for at least a certain amount
            of time or timesteps before being perturbed.
        hyperparam_mutations: Hyperparams to mutate. The format is
            as follows: for each key, either a list, function,
            or a tune search space object (tune.loguniform, tune.uniform,
            etc.) can be provided. A list specifies an allowed set of
            categorical values. A function or tune search space object
            specifies the distribution of a continuous parameter. You must
            use tune.choice, tune.uniform, tune.loguniform, etc.. Arbitrary
            tune.sample_from objects are not supported.
            A key can also hold a dict for nested hyperparameters.
            You must specify at least one of `hyperparam_mutations` or
            `custom_explore_fn`.
            Tune will sample the search space provided by
            `hyperparam_mutations` for the initial hyperparameter values if the
            corresponding hyperparameters are not present in a trial's initial `config`.
        quantile_fraction: Parameters are transferred from the top
            `quantile_fraction` fraction of trials to the bottom
            `quantile_fraction` fraction. Needs to be between 0 and 0.5.
            Setting it to 0 essentially implies doing no exploitation at all.
        resample_probability: The probability of resampling from the
            original distribution when applying `hyperparam_mutations`. If not
            resampled, the value will be perturbed by a factor chosen from
            `perturbation_factors` if continuous, or changed to an adjacent value
            if discrete.
        perturbation_factors: Scaling factors to choose between when mutating
            a continuous hyperparameter.
        custom_explore_fn: You can also specify a custom exploration
            function. This function is invoked as `f(config)` after built-in
            perturbations from `hyperparam_mutations` are applied, and should
            return `config` updated as needed. You must specify at least one of
            `hyperparam_mutations` or `custom_explore_fn`.
        log_config: Whether to log the ray config of each model to
            local_dir at each exploit. Allows config schedule to be
            reconstructed.
        require_attrs: Whether to require time_attr and metric to appear
            in result for every iteration. If True, error will be raised
            if these values are not present in trial result.
        synch: If False, will use asynchronous implementation of
            PBT. Trial perturbations occur every perturbation_interval for each
            trial independently. If True, will use synchronous implementation
            of PBT. Perturbations will occur only after all trials are
            synced at the same time_attr every perturbation_interval.
            Defaults to False. See Appendix A.1 here
            https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf.

    """Replays a Population Based Training run.

    Population Based Training does not return a single hyperparameter
    configuration, but rather a schedule of configurations. For instance,
    PBT might discover that a larger learning rate leads to good results
    in the first training iterations, but that a smaller learning rate
    is preferable later.

    This scheduler enables replaying these parameter schedules from
    a finished PBT run. This requires that population based training has
    been run with ``log_config=True``, which is the default setting.

    The scheduler will only accept and train a single trial. It will
    start with the initial config of the existing trial and update the
    config according to the schedule.

    Args:
        policy_file: The PBT policy file. Usually this is
            stored in ``~/ray_results/experiment_name/pbt_policy_xxx.txt``
