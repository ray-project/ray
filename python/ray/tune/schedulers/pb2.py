class PB2(PopulationBasedTraining):
    """Implements the Population Based Bandit (PB2) algorithm.

    PB2 trains a group of models (or agents) in parallel. Periodically, poorly
    performing models clone the state of the top performers, and the hyper-
    parameters are re-selected using GP-bandit optimization. The GP model is
    trained to predict the improvement in the next training period.

    Like PBT, PB2 adapts hyperparameters during training time. This enables
    very fast hyperparameter discovery and also automatically discovers
    schedules.

    This Tune PB2 implementation is built on top of Tune's PBT implementation.
    It considers all trials added as part of the PB2 population. If the number
    of trials exceeds the cluster capacity, they will be time-multiplexed as to
    balance training progress across the population. To run multiple trials,
    use `tune.TuneConfig(num_samples=<int>)`.

    In {LOG_DIR}/{MY_EXPERIMENT_NAME}/, all mutations are logged in
    `pb2_global.txt` and individual policy perturbations are recorded
    in pb2_policy_{i}.txt. Tune logs: [target trial tag, clone trial tag,
    target trial iteration, clone trial iteration, old config, new config]
    on each perturbation step.

    Args:
        time_attr: The training result attr to use for comparing time.
            Note that you can pass in something non-temporal such as
            `training_iteration` as a measure of progress, the only requirement
            is that the attribute should increase monotonically.
        metric: The training result objective value attribute. Stopping
            procedures will use this attribute.
        mode: One of {min, max}. Determines whether objective is
            minimizing or maximizing the metric attribute.
        perturbation_interval: Models will be considered for
            perturbation at this interval of `time_attr`. Note that
            perturbation incurs checkpoint overhead, so you shouldn't set this
            to be too frequent.
        hyperparam_bounds: Hyperparameters to mutate. The format is
            as follows: for each key, enter a list of the form [min, max]
            representing the minimum and maximum possible hyperparam values.
        quantile_fraction: Parameters are transferred from the top
            `quantile_fraction` fraction of trials to the bottom
            `quantile_fraction` fraction. Needs to be between 0 and 0.5.
            Setting it to 0 essentially implies doing no exploitation at all.
        log_config: Whether to log the ray config of each model to
            local_dir at each exploit. Allows config schedule to be
            reconstructed.
        require_attrs: Whether to require time_attr and metric to appear
            in result for every iteration. If True, error will be raised
            if these values are not present in trial result.
        synch: If False, will use asynchronous implementation of
            PBT. Trial perturbations occur every perturbation_interval for each
            trial independently. If True, will use synchronous implementation
            of PBT. Perturbations will occur only after all trials are
            synced at the same time_attr every perturbation_interval.
            Defaults to False. See Appendix A.1 here
            https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf.
