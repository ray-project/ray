    This object defines how to act in the environment, and also losses used to
    improve the policy based on its experiences. Note that both policy and
    loss are defined together for convenience, though the policy itself is
    logically separate.

    All policies can directly extend PolicyGraph, however TensorFlow users may
    find TFPolicyGraph simpler to implement. TFPolicyGraph also enables RLlib
    to apply TensorFlow-specific optimizations such as fusing multiple policy
    graphs and multi-GPU support.
