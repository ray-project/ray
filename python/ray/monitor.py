    The monitor is in charge of cleaning up the tables in the global state

    detecting component failures.

    Attributes:
        redis: A connection to the Redis server.
        subscribe_client: A pubsub client for the Redis server. This is used to
            receive notifications about failed components.
        subscribed: A dictionary mapping channel names (str) to whether or not
            the subscription to that channel has succeeded yet (bool).
        dead_local_schedulers: A set of the local scheduler IDs of all of the
            local schedulers that were up at one point and have died since
            then.
        live_plasma_managers: A counter mapping live plasma manager IDs to the
            number of heartbeats that have passed since we last heard from that
            plasma manager. A plasma manager is live if we received a heartbeat
            from it at any point, and if it has not timed out.
