"""
New, fast version of the CloudPickler.

This new CloudPickler class can now extend the fast C Pickler instead of the
previous Python implementation of the Pickler class. Because this functionality
is only available for Python versions 3.8+, a lot of backward-compatibility
code is also removed.

Note that the C Pickler sublassing API is CPython-specific. Therefore, some
guards present in cloudpickle.py that were written to handle PyPy specificities
are not present in cloudpickle_fast.py

        special reducer_override method.

        Note that method will be called for any object except a few
        builtin-types (int, lists, dicts etc.), which differs from reducers in
        the Pickler's dispatch_table, each of them being invoked for objects of
        a specific type only.

        This property comes in handy for classes: although most classes are
        instances of the ``type`` metaclass, some of them can be instances of
        other custom metaclasses (such as enum.EnumMeta for example). In
        particular, the metaclass will likely not be known in advance, and thus
        cannot be special-cased using an entry in the dispatch_table.
        reducer_override, among other things, allows us to register a reducer
