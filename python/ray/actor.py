    """A handle to an actor.

    The fields in this class are prefixed with _ray_ to hide them from the user
    and to avoid collision with actor method names.

    An ActorHandle can be created in three ways. First, by calling .remote() on
    an ActorClass. Second, by passing an actor handle into a task (forking the
    ActorHandle). Third, by directly serializing the ActorHandle (e.g., with
    cloudpickle).

    Attributes:
        _ray_actor_language: The actor language.
        _ray_actor_id: Actor ID.
        _ray_method_decorators: Optional decorators for the function
            invocation. This can be used to change the behavior on the
            invocation side, whereas a regular decorator can be used to change
            the behavior on the execution side.
        _ray_method_signatures: The signatures of the actor methods.
        _ray_method_num_return_vals: The default number of return values for
            each method.
        _ray_actor_method_cpus: The number of CPUs required by actor methods.
        _ray_original_handle: True if this is the original actor handle for a
            given actor. If this is true, then the actor will be destroyed when
            this handle goes out of scope.
        _ray_is_cross_language: Whether this actor is cross language.
        _ray_actor_creation_function_descriptor: The function descriptor
            of the actor creation task.
