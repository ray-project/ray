    Attributes:
        _ray_actor_id: The ID of the corresponding actor.
        _ray_module_name: The module name of this actor.
        _ray_actor_handle_id: The ID of this handle. If this is the "original"
            handle for an actor (as opposed to one created by passing another
            handle into a task), then this ID must be NIL_ID. If this
            ActorHandle was created by forking an existing ActorHandle, then
            this ID must be computed deterministically via
            compute_actor_handle_id. If this ActorHandle was created by an
            out-of-band mechanism (e.g., pickling), then this must be None (in
            this case, a new actor handle ID will be generated on the fly every
            time a method is invoked).
        _ray_actor_cursor: The actor cursor is a dummy object representing the
            most recent actor method invocation. For each subsequent method
            invocation, the current cursor should be added as a dependency, and
            then updated to reflect the new invocation.
        _ray_actor_counter: The number of actor method invocations that we've
            called so far.
        _ray_actor_method_names: The names of the actor methods.
        _ray_method_decorators: Optional decorators for the function
            invocation. This can be used to change the behavior on the
            invocation side, whereas a regular decorator can be used to change
            the behavior on the execution side.
        _ray_method_signatures: The signatures of the actor methods.
        _ray_method_num_return_vals: The default number of return values for
            each method.
        _ray_class_name: The name of the actor class.
        _ray_actor_forks: The number of times this handle has been forked.
        _ray_actor_creation_dummy_object_id: The dummy object ID from the actor
            creation task.
        _ray_actor_method_cpus: The number of CPUs required by actor methods.
        _ray_original_handle: True if this is the original actor handle for a
            given actor. If this is true, then the actor will be destroyed when
            this handle goes out of scope.
        _ray_actor_job_id: The ID of the job that created the actor
            (it is possible that this ActorHandle exists on a job with a
            different job ID).
        _ray_new_actor_handles: The new actor handles that were created from
            this handle since the last task on this handle was submitted. This
            is used to garbage-collect dummy objects that are no longer
            necessary in the backend.
