    cloudpickle).

            handle into a task), then this ID must be NIL_ID. If this
            ActorHandle was created by forking an existing ActorHandle, then
            this ID must be computed deterministically via
            compute_actor_handle_id. If this ActorHandle was created by an

            most recent actor method invocation. For each subsequent method
            invocation, the current cursor should be added as a dependency, and
            then updated to reflect the new invocation.
        _ray_actor_counter: The number of actor method invocations that we've
            called so far.
        _ray_actor_method_names: The names of the actor methods.
        _ray_method_signatures: The signatures of the actor methods.
        _ray_method_num_return_vals: The default number of return values for
            each method.
        _ray_class_name: The name of the actor class.
        _ray_actor_forks: The number of times this handle has been forked.
        _ray_actor_creation_dummy_object_id: The dummy object ID from the actor
            creation task.
        _ray_actor_method_cpus: The number of CPUs required by actor methods.

            given actor. If this is true, then the actor will be destroyed when
            this handle goes out of scope.
