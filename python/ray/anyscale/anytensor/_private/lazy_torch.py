"""Import alias for torch that makes all usages of the module *lazy*.

`torch` is a very heavyweight module (takes ~0.5s to import) and we want to avoid
importing it in spawned subprocesses as it impacts forking performance.

This module should therefore be used as a drop-in replacement for `torch` everywhere
in the codebase. Example:

# Before:
import torch
torch.dtype

# After:
from ray.anyscale.anytensor._private.lazy_torch import torch
torch.dtype
"""
