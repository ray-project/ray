__label__3	Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .
__label__2	It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
__label__2	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .
__label__2	Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .
__label__4	Slick piece of cross-promotion .
__label__1	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .
__label__3	It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .
__label__1	It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .
__label__2	Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi 's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) .
__label__1	( T ) here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
__label__2	It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .
__label__3	The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .
__label__1	I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
__label__3	Apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other .
__label__2	Too much of the humor falls flat .
__label__2	Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .
__label__3	Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
__label__2	The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
__label__2	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .
__label__3	The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous ( but with bears , and a G rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
__label__1	No way I can believe this load of junk .
__label__3	`` Roger Michell ( '' Notting Hill `` ) directs a morality thriller . ''
__label__1	It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
__label__1	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
__label__1	Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
__label__2	The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
__label__3	But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
__label__2	Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .
__label__2	And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .
__label__3	There 's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichÃ©d , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club .
__label__1	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
__label__3	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
__label__1	The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
__label__1	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
__label__1	It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
__label__2	This movie is maddening .
__label__3	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
__label__2	Should have been someone else -
__label__2	The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
__label__1	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
__label__3	Would n't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
__label__2	The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .
__label__2	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
__label__2	... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .
__label__1	I had to look away - this was god awful .
__label__3	Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .
__label__2	Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
__label__2	Just one bad idea after another .
__label__2	Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
__label__2	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
__label__3	A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
__label__2	Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
__label__2	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
__label__2	It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
__label__2	A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .
__label__1	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
__label__2	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
__label__2	It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
__label__2	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
__label__2	Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
__label__1	An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .
__label__1	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
__label__3	Hey Arnold !
__label__3	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
__label__1	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
__label__2	Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
__label__2	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
__label__4	A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
__label__2	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
__label__2	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
__label__1	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
__label__5	We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !
__label__1	Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
__label__2	The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .
__label__3	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
__label__2	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
__label__3	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
__label__2	Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
__label__1	Try as I may , I ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '
__label__2	when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
__label__3	While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
__label__1	It treats women like idiots .
__label__3	Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
__label__3	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
__label__2	A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .
__label__2	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
__label__2	For starters , the story is just too slim .
__label__4	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
__label__1	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
__label__3	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
__label__2	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
__label__1	Almost gags on its own gore .
__label__1	How do you spell clichÃ© ?
__label__3	It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
__label__1	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
__label__2	While ( Hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
__label__1	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
__label__3	Under 15 ?
__label__5	A giggle a minute .
__label__3	Over age 15 ?
__label__1	Big Fat Waste of Time .
__label__3	Hey Arnold !
__label__1	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
__label__2	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
__label__1	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
__label__1	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
__label__2	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
__label__2	Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .
__label__1	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
__label__2	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .
__label__3	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
__label__3	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
__label__3	Yes , Ballistic is silly .
__label__1	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
__label__3	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
__label__2	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
__label__2	While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( Sugar Hill Gang , etc. ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
__label__1	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
__label__2	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
__label__2	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
__label__2	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .
__label__1	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
__label__3	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence
__label__3	A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
__label__1	Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
__label__2	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
__label__2	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
__label__1	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
__label__1	Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
__label__2	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
__label__3	It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
__label__2	Holden Caulfield did it better .
__label__2	A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
__label__2	Oh come on .
__label__1	Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
__label__3	If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
__label__3	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
__label__2	Not exactly the Bees Knees
__label__2	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
__label__3	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
__label__3	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
__label__2	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
__label__3	Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
__label__3	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
__label__2	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
__label__1	It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
__label__3	This is nothing but familiar territory .
__label__2	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
__label__1	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
__label__2	A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
__label__2	Too slow , too long and too little happens .
__label__1	The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
__label__2	It 's just filler .
__label__2	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
__label__2	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
__label__2	A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .
__label__1	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
__label__2	It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
__label__3	They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
__label__3	Barely gets off the ground .
__label__2	Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .
__label__2	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
__label__4	At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s .
__label__1	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
__label__2	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
__label__1	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
__label__3	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
__label__3	Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .
__label__2	A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .
__label__2	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
__label__1	Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
__label__3	Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
__label__2	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
__label__2	Do not see this film .
__label__4	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
__label__2	Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .
__label__2	If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
__label__2	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
__label__1	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
__label__3	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
__label__2	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
__label__3	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
__label__1	It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .
__label__2	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
__label__2	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
__label__3	To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
__label__2	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
__label__2	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
__label__1	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
__label__3	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
__label__2	... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
__label__2	It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
__label__1	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
__label__1	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
__label__1	A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
__label__2	Once ( Kim ) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
__label__1	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
__label__3	What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
__label__2	All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
__label__2	A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .
__label__1	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
__label__2	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
__label__3	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
__label__2	For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
__label__2	A coarse and stupid gross-out .
__label__2	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
__label__2	Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
__label__3	There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
__label__1	It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
__label__3	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
__label__1	But the power of these ( subjects ) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
__label__2	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
__label__2	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
__label__1	Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .
__label__2	That 's a cheat .
__label__4	Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
__label__1	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
__label__2	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
__label__2	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
__label__2	Basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .
__label__2	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
__label__3	An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director John McKay can swallow .
__label__4	It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
__label__1	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
__label__1	It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
__label__2	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
__label__3	A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .
__label__3	It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
__label__3	columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
__label__3	The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .
__label__3	I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .
__label__4	It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
__label__3	Socrates motions for hemlock .
__label__2	The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work .
__label__3	Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
__label__2	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
__label__3	It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
__label__3	Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .
__label__2	I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
__label__3	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
__label__1	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
__label__3	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
__label__2	I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
__label__2	Its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
__label__2	For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
__label__1	Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .
__label__1	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
__label__3	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
__label__2	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .
__label__2	A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .
__label__2	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
__label__3	There can be no other explanation .
__label__4	Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
__label__2	Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
__label__1	( A ) shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
__label__2	Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
__label__1	Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
__label__2	a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
__label__2	A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
__label__2	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
__label__3	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
__label__4	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
__label__1	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
__label__2	It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
__label__2	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
__label__1	( director ) O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
__label__3	The intent is almost exactly the same ( as The Full Monty ) .
__label__2	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
__label__1	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
__label__2	Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
__label__2	There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
__label__3	It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
__label__4	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
__label__2	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
__label__3	More maudlin than sharp .
__label__4	This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
__label__1	It 's slow -- very , very slow .
__label__2	It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
__label__2	That 's pure PR hype .
__label__2	Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .
__label__2	Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
__label__2	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
__label__1	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
__label__2	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
__label__3	If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .
__label__1	I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
__label__1	And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
__label__2	It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
__label__1	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
__label__1	... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
__label__1	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
__label__1	My reaction in a word : disappointment .
__label__1	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
__label__3	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
__label__2	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
__label__4	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
__label__1	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
__label__2	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
__label__2	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
__label__3	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
__label__3	A workshop mentality prevails .
__label__1	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
__label__1	Yes , dull .
__label__3	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
__label__2	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
__label__2	( W ) hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
__label__2	Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
__label__1	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
__label__2	An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
__label__1	A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...
__label__3	It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
__label__1	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
__label__3	New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
__label__2	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
__label__3	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
__label__3	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
__label__2	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
__label__2	This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .
__label__3	This is her Blue Lagoon .
__label__2	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
__label__2	... the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) ...
__label__2	Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
__label__2	An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
__label__1	Has all the depth of a wading pool .
__label__2	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
__label__1	The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .
__label__1	... the movie is just a plain old monster .
__label__3	If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
__label__2	One long string of cliches .
__label__2	Fancy a real downer ?
__label__3	( Leigh ) lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
__label__1	Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
__label__1	Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
__label__3	Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
__label__3	But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
__label__2	At once half-baked and overheated .
__label__3	There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
__label__3	I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
__label__4	( Serry ) wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
__label__2	It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
__label__3	By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .
__label__2	Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .
__label__2	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
__label__3	Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
__label__2	Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
__label__2	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
__label__2	I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
__label__3	A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .
__label__3	... think of it as American Pie On Valium .
__label__1	Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
__label__1	It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
__label__2	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
__label__3	Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic /
__label__3	Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .
__label__3	For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
__label__2	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
__label__1	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
__label__3	Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
__label__3	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
__label__2	It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
__label__2	As vulgar as it is banal .
__label__2	You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
__label__2	The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
__label__2	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
__label__2	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
__label__1	Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
__label__2	Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
__label__2	A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
__label__2	Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
__label__2	A sometimes tedious film .
__label__2	Teen movies have really hit the skids .
__label__1	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
__label__2	... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
__label__3	Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
__label__1	What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
__label__4	does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
__label__3	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
__label__2	just not campy enough
__label__2	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
__label__1	It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
__label__2	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
__label__1	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
__label__1	For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
__label__2	American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian-American would recognize .
__label__2	And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
__label__2	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
__label__2	Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
__label__1	... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
__label__1	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
__label__2	Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .
__label__1	Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .
__label__2	It 's a buggy drag .
__label__2	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
__label__2	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
__label__1	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
__label__1	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
__label__1	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
__label__1	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
__label__1	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
__label__4	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
__label__3	Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
__label__2	... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .
__label__1	Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
__label__2	I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .
__label__2	There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
__label__2	The tale of Tok ( Andy Lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O ( Takashi Sorimachi ) , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
__label__2	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
__label__3	A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of ( Besson 's ) earlier work .
__label__1	A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
__label__1	Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
__label__4	... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
__label__2	Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
__label__2	This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
__label__4	While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
__label__2	It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
__label__3	Let 's hope -- shall we ?
__label__2	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
__label__2	If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
__label__1	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
__label__2	Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
__label__2	But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
__label__1	Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
__label__2	It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
__label__2	Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
__label__1	Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
__label__2	The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
__label__2	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
__label__4	A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
__label__2	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
__label__2	To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
__label__2	At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .
__label__3	The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
__label__1	As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
__label__1	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
__label__2	There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
__label__3	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
__label__2	It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
__label__3	Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
__label__2	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
__label__2	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
__label__2	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
__label__1	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
__label__2	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
__label__1	Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
__label__1	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
__label__3	Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
__label__3	It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
__label__2	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
__label__2	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
__label__2	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
__label__3	I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
__label__2	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
__label__2	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
__label__4	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
__label__2	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
__label__1	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
__label__2	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
__label__2	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
__label__1	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
__label__2	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
__label__2	Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .
__label__2	It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
__label__2	Bad .
__label__1	Very bad .
__label__1	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
__label__2	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
__label__2	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
__label__2	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
__label__2	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
__label__2	Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
__label__1	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
__label__3	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
__label__2	Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
__label__3	Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
__label__2	But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
__label__3	Long Time Dead ?
__label__3	Not nearly long enough .
__label__3	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
__label__4	A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
__label__2	There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
__label__2	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
__label__2	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
__label__2	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
__label__4	McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
__label__2	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .
__label__3	Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
__label__3	Who needs love like this ?
__label__2	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
__label__3	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
__label__3	Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
__label__1	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
__label__1	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
__label__2	It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
__label__3	Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
__label__2	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
__label__2	A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
__label__1	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
__label__2	I 'm just too bored to care .
__label__2	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
__label__3	As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .
__label__2	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
__label__1	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
__label__2	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
__label__2	Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
__label__3	A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
__label__1	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
__label__1	This is so bad .
__label__3	Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .
__label__3	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
__label__2	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
__label__2	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
__label__2	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
__label__2	It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
__label__1	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
__label__3	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
__label__2	At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
__label__2	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
__label__2	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
__label__2	The end result is a film that 's neither .
__label__2	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
__label__2	Something like scrubbing the toilet .
__label__2	Or emptying rat traps .
__label__2	Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
__label__4	Scooby Dooby Doo / And Shaggy too / You both look and sound great .
__label__2	/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff / Fred thinks he 's tough / And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
__label__2	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
__label__2	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
__label__2	However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
__label__1	The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
__label__2	But it could have been worse .
__label__2	Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
__label__1	Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
__label__1	comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
__label__2	... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
__label__2	it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
__label__2	It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
__label__2	The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
__label__3	Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
__label__2	Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
