    # NB:
    # In order to start ray worker nodes on spark cluster worker machines,
    # We launch a background spark job:
    #  1. Each spark task launches one ray worker node. This design ensures all ray
    #     worker nodes have the same shape (same cpus / gpus / memory configuration).
    #     If ray worker nodes have a non-uniform shape, the Ray cluster setup will
    #     be non-deterministic and could create issues with node sizing.
    #  2. A ray worker node is started via the `ray start` CLI. In each spark task,
    #     a child process is started and will execute a `ray start ...` command in
    #     blocking mode.
    #  3. Each task will acquire a file lock for 10s to ensure that the ray worker
    #     init will acquire a port connection to the ray head node that does not
    #     contend with other worker processes on the same Spark worker node.
    #  4. When the ray cluster is shutdown, killing ray worker nodes is implemented by:
    #     Installing a PR_SET_PDEATHSIG signal for the `ray start ...` child processes
    #     so that when parent process (pyspark task) is killed, the child processes
    #     (`ray start ...` processes) will receive a SIGTERM signal, killing it.
    #     Shutting down the ray cluster is performed by calling
    #     `sparkContext.cancelJobGroup` to cancel the background spark job, sending a
    #     SIGKILL signal to all spark tasks. Once the spark tasks are killed, this
    #     triggers the sending of a SIGTERM to the child processes spawned by the
    #     `ray_start ...` process.

    Initialize a ray cluster on the spark cluster by starting a ray head node in the
    spark application's driver side node.
    After creating the head node, a background spark job is created that
    generates an instance of `RayClusterOnSpark` that contains configuration for the
    ray cluster that will run on the Spark cluster's worker nodes.
    After a ray cluster initialized, your python process automatically connect to the
    ray cluster, you can call `ray.util.spark.shutdown_ray_cluster` to shut down the
    ray cluster.
    Note: If the active ray cluster haven't shut down, you cannot create a new ray
    cluster.

    Args
        num_worker_nodes: The number of spark worker nodes that the spark job will be
            submitted to. This argument represents how many concurrent spark tasks will
            be available in the creation of the ray cluster. The ray cluster's total
            available resources (memory, CPU and/or GPU) is equal to the quantity of
            resources allocated within these spark tasks.
            Specifying the `num_worker_nodes` as `-1` represents a ray cluster
            configuration that will use all available spark tasks slots (and resources
            allocated to the spark application) on the spark cluster.
            To create a spark cluster that is intended to be used exclusively as a
            shared ray cluster, it is recommended to set this argument to
            `ray.spark.utils.MAX_NUM_WORKER_NODES`.
        object_store_memory_per_node: Object store memory available to per-ray worker
            node, but it is capped by
            "dev_shm_available_size * 0.8 / num_tasks_per_spark_worker".
            The default value equals to
            "dev_shm_available_size * 0.8 / num_tasks_per_spark_worker".
        head_options: A dict representing Ray head node options.
        worker_options: A dict representing Ray worker node options.
        ray_temp_root_dir: A local disk path to store the ray temporary data. The
            created cluster will create a subdirectory
            "ray-{head_port}-{random_suffix}" beneath this path.
        safe_mode: Boolean flag to fast-fail initialization of the ray cluster if
            the available spark cluster does not have sufficient resources to fulfill
            the resource allocation for memory, cpu and gpu. When set to true, if the
            requested resources are not available for minimum recommended
            functionality, an exception will be raised that details the inadequate
            spark cluster configuration settings. If overridden as `False`,
            a warning is raised.
        collect_log_to_path: If specified, after ray head / worker nodes terminated,
            collect their logs to the specified path. On Databricks Runtime, we
            recommend you to specify a local path starts with '/dbfs/', because the
            path mounts with a centralized storage device and stored data is persisted
            after databricks spark cluster terminated.
