    The implementation for distributed sort tasks.

    The algorithm is similar to [External Merge Sort]
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting).
    Sorting is done in 3 steps: sampling, sorting individual blocks, and
    merging sorted blocks.

    Sampling (`sample_boundaries`): we get a number of sample items from each block,
    sort them, and use them to compute boundaries that would partition all items into
    approximately equal ranges.

    Sorting (`map`): each block is sorted locally, then partitioned into smaller
    blocks according to the boundaries. Each partitioned block is passed to a merge
    task.

    Merging (`reduce`): a merge task would receive a block from every worker that
    consists of items in a certain range. It then merges the sorted blocks into one
    sorted block and becomes part of the new, sorted block.
