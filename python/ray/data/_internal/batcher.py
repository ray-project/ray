    This function first creates a batcher implementation

    Args:
        batch_size: The size of batches to yield.
        shuffle_buffer_min_size: If non-None, the data will be randomly shuffled
            using a local in-memory shuffle buffer, and this value will serve as the
            minimum number of rows that must be in the local in-memory shuffle buffer in
            order to yield a batch.
        shuffle_seed: The seed to use for the local random shuffle.
        ensure_copy: Whether batches are always copied from the underlying base
            blocks (not zero-copy views).
        stats: Optional stats object for timing batch operations.
        drop_last: Whether to drop the last incomplete batch.
        batcher_factory_fn: a factory function that creates a BatcherInterface
        **kwargs: kwargs to pass to the batcher's constructor or factory function

    Returns:
        A BatcherBasedBatchingIterator.
