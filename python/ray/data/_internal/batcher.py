    # Implementation Note:
    #
    # This shuffling batcher lazily builds a shuffle buffer from added blocks, and once
    # a batch is requested via .next_batch(), it concatenates the blocks into a concrete
    # shuffle buffer, generates random shuffle indices, and starts returning shuffled
    # batches.
    #
    # Adding of more blocks can be intermixed with retrieving batches, but it should be
    # noted that we can end up performing two expensive operations on each retrieval:
    #  1. Build added blocks into a concrete shuffle buffer.
    #  2. Generate random shuffle indices.
    # Note that (1) and (2) only happen when new blocks are added, upon the next
    # retrieval. I.e., if no new blocks have been added since the last batch retrieval,
    # and there are still batches in the existing concrete shuffle buffer to be yielded,
    # then each batch retrieval will only involve slicing the batch out of the concrete
    # shuffle buffer.
    #
    # Similarly, adding blocks is very cheap. Each added block will be appended to a
    # list, with concatenation of the underlying data delayed until the next batch
    # retrieval.
    #
    # Since (1) runs of block additions are cheap, and (2) runs of batch retrievals are
    # cheap, callers of ShufflingBatcher are encouraged to add as many blocks as
    # possible (up to the shuffle buffer capacity), followed by retrieving as many
    # batches as possible (down to the shuffle buffer minimum size), in such contiguous
    # runs.
