class PhysicalOperator:

    An operator transforms one or more input streams of RefBundles into a single
    output stream of RefBundles.

    Operators are stateful and non-serializable; they live on the driver side of the
    Dataset execution only.

    Here's a simple example of implementing a basic "Map" operator:

        class Map(PhysicalOperator):
            def __init__(self):
                self.active_tasks = []

            def add_input(self, refs, _):

            def get_next(self):
                ready, remaining = ray.wait(self.active_tasks, num_returns=1)
                self.active_tasks = remaining
                return ready[0]

    Note that the above operator fully supports both bulk and streaming execution,
    since `add_input` and `get_next` can be called in any order. In bulk execution,
    all inputs would be added up-front, but in streaming execution the calls could
    be interleaved.
