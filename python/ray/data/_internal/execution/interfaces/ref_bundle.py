    Most commonly a RefBundle consists of a single block object reference.
    In some cases, e.g., due to block splitting, or for a reduce task, there may
    be more than one block.

    Block bundles have ownership semantics, i.e., shared ownership (similar to C++
    shared_ptr, multiple operators share the same block bundle), or unique ownership
    (similar to C++ unique_ptr, only one operator owns the block bundle). This
    allows operators to know whether they can destroy blocks when they don't need
    them. Destroying blocks eagerly is more efficient than waiting for Python GC /
    Ray reference counting to kick in.
