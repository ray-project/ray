    An operator transforms one or more input streams of RefBundles into a single

    Physical operators are stateful and non-serializable; they live on the driver side
    of the Dataset only.

    Here's a simple example of implementing a basic "Map" operator:

        class MapOperator(PhysicalOperator):
            def __init__(self):

                self.active_tasks = remaining
                return ready[0]

    Note that the above operator fully supports both bulk and streaming execution,
    since `add_input` and `get_next` can be called in any order. In bulk execution,
    all inputs would be added up-front, but in streaming execution the calls could
    be interleaved.
