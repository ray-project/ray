    """Backpressure policy that limits output reading based on downstream capacity.

    This policy prevents OOMs by estimating the maximum amount of data that can be
    queued for downstream operators based on:
    1. Global cluster resource limits
    2. Resources required per task/actor in downstream operators
    3. Average number of input blocks consumed per task

    The policy calculates an upper bound for downstream processing capacity and
    uses a multiple of that capacity as the limit for how much data should be
    queued downstream. This is done to account for the discrete scheduling steps
    in Ray Data. We primarily want to limit runaway accumulation of data, rather
    than hard stop the accumulation at the exact capacity we are estimating.
