class ActorPoolMapOperator(MapOperator):
    """A MapOperator implementation that executes tasks on an actor pool.

    This class manages the state of a pool of actors used for task execution, as well
    as dispatch of tasks to those actors.

    It operates in two modes. In bulk mode, tasks are queued internally and executed
    when the operator has free actor slots. In streaming mode, the streaming executor
    only adds input when `should_add_input() = True` (i.e., there are free slots).
    This allows for better control of backpressure (e.g., suppose we go over memory
    limits after adding put, then there isn't any way to "take back" the inputs prior
    to actual execution).
