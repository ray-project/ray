"""
We implement a distributed sorting algorithm similar to
[External Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting).
Sorting is done in 3 stages: sampling, sorting individual blocks, and
merging sorted blocks.

Sampling: we get a number of sample items from each block, sort them, and
use them to compute boundaries that would partition all items into
approximately equal ranges.

Sorting: each block is sorted locally, then partitioned into smaller blocks
according to the boundaries. Each partitioned block is passed to a merge task.
This is an all-to-all shuffle.

Merging: a merge task would receive a block from every worker that consists
of items in a certain range. It then merges the sorted blocks into one sorted
block and becomes part of the new, sorted dataset.
