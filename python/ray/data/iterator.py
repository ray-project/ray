        This is only supported for datasets convertible to Arrow records.

        It is recommended to use the returned ``IterableDataset`` directly
        instead of passing it into a torch ``DataLoader``.

        Each element in IterableDataset will be a tuple consisting of 2
        elements. The first item contains the feature tensor(s), and the
        second item is the label tensor. Those can take on different
        forms, depending on the specified arguments.

        For the features tensor (N is the ``batch_size`` and n, m, k
        are the number of features per tensor):

        * If ``feature_columns`` is a ``List[str]``, the features will be
          a tensor of shape (N, n), with columns corresponding to
          ``feature_columns``

        * If ``feature_columns`` is a ``List[List[str]]``, the features will be
          a list of tensors of shape [(N, m),...,(N, k)], with columns of each
          tensor corresponding to the elements of ``feature_columns``

        * If ``feature_columns`` is a ``Dict[str, List[str]]``, the features
          will be a dict of key-tensor pairs of shape
          {key1: (N, m),..., keyN: (N, k)}, with columns of each
          tensor corresponding to the value of ``feature_columns`` under the
          key.

        If ``unsqueeze_label_tensor=True`` (default), the label tensor will be
        of shape (N, 1). Otherwise, it will be of shape (N,).
        If ``label_column`` is specified as ``None``, then no column from the
        ``Dataset`` will be treated as the label, and the output label tensor
        will be ``None``.

        Note that you probably want to call ``.split()`` on this dataset if
        there are to be multiple Torch workers consuming the data.

        Time complexity: O(1)

        Args:
            label_column: The name of the column used as the
                label (second element of the output list). Can be None for
                prediction, in which case the second element of returned
                tuple will also be None.
            feature_columns: The names of the columns
                to use as the features. Can be a list of lists or
                a dict of string-list pairs for multi-tensor output.
                If None, then use all columns except the label column as
                the features.
            label_column_dtype: The torch dtype to
                use for the label column. If None, then automatically infer
                the dtype.
            feature_column_dtypes: The dtypes to use for the feature
                tensors. This should match the format of ``feature_columns``,
                or be a single dtype, in which case it will be applied to
                all tensors. If None, then automatically infer the dtype.
            batch_size: How many samples per batch to yield at a time.
                Defaults to 1.
            prefetch_batches: The number of batches to fetch ahead of the current batch
                to fetch. If set to greater than 0, a separate threadpool will be used
                to fetch the objects to the local node, format the batches, and apply
                the collate_fn. Defaults to 1. You can revert back to the old
                prefetching behavior that uses `prefetch_blocks` by setting
                `use_legacy_iter_batches` to True in the DataContext.
            drop_last: Set to True to drop the last incomplete batch,
                if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If
                False and the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch
                size, then the last batch will be smaller. Defaults to False.
            local_shuffle_buffer_size: If non-None, the data will be randomly shuffled
                using a local in-memory shuffle buffer, and this value will serve as the
                minimum number of rows that must be in the local in-memory shuffle
                buffer in order to yield a batch. When there are no more rows to add to
                the buffer, the remaining rows in the buffer will be drained. This
                buffer size must be greater than or equal to ``batch_size``, and
                therefore ``batch_size`` must also be specified when using local
                shuffling.
            local_shuffle_seed: The seed to use for the local random shuffle.
            unsqueeze_label_tensor: If set to True, the label tensor
                will be unsqueezed (reshaped to (N, 1)). Otherwise, it will
                be left as is, that is (N, ). In general, regression loss
                functions expect an unsqueezed tensor, while classification
                loss functions expect a squeezed one. Defaults to True.
            unsqueeze_feature_tensors: If set to True, the features tensors
                will be unsqueezed (reshaped to (N, 1)) before being concatenated into
                the final features tensor. Otherwise, they will be left as is, that is
                (N, ). Defaults to True.
