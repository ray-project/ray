"""
DataFusion optimization execution layer for Ray Data SQL API.

This module enhances the existing QueryExecutor with DataFusion optimization
hints, reusing all the well-tested SQLGlot execution logic while applying
DataFusion's cost-based optimization decisions.

Key Design: REUSE existing QueryExecutor, don't reimplement!
- QueryExecutor already handles filters, joins, projections, aggregations
- DataFusion provides optimization hints (order, placement)
- We configure the existing executor to apply hints
