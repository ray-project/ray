    """Connect to an existing Ray cluster or start one and connect to it.

    This method handles two cases. Either a Ray cluster already exists and we
    just attach this driver to it, or we start all of the processes associated
    with a Ray cluster and attach to the newly started cluster.

    To start Ray and all of the relevant processes, use this as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        ray.init()

    To connect to an existing Ray cluster, use this as follows (substituting
    in the appropriate address):

    .. code-block:: python

        ray.init(address="123.45.67.89:6379")

    Args:
        address (str): The address of the Ray cluster to connect to. If
            this address is not provided, then this command will start Redis, a
            raylet, a plasma store, a plasma manager, and some workers.
            It will also kill these processes when Python exits.
        redis_address (str): Deprecated; same as address.
        num_cpus (int): Number of cpus the user wishes all raylets to
            be configured with.
        num_gpus (int): Number of gpus the user wishes all raylets to
            be configured with.
        resources: A dictionary mapping the name of a resource to the quantity
            of that resource available.
        memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) that is available for use by
            workers requesting memory resources. By default, this is autoset
            based on available system memory.
        object_store_memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) to start the
            object store with. By default, this is autoset based on available
            system memory, subject to a 20GB cap.
        redis_max_memory: The max amount of memory (in bytes) to allow each
            redis shard to use. Once the limit is exceeded, redis will start
            LRU eviction of entries. This only applies to the sharded redis
            tables (task, object, and profile tables).  By default, this is
            autoset based on available system memory, subject to a 10GB cap.
        log_to_driver (bool): If true, then output from all of the worker
            processes on all nodes will be directed to the driver.
        node_ip_address (str): The IP address of the node that we are on.
        object_id_seed (int): Used to seed the deterministic generation of
            object IDs. The same value can be used across multiple runs of the
            same driver in order to generate the object IDs in a consistent
            manner. However, the same ID should not be used for different
            drivers.
        local_mode (bool): True if the code should be executed serially
            without Ray. This is useful for debugging.
        driver_object_store_memory (int): Limit the amount of memory the driver
            can use in the object store for creating objects. By default, this
            is autoset based on available system memory, subject to a 20GB cap.
        ignore_reinit_error: True if we should suppress errors from calling
            ray.init() a second time.
        num_redis_shards: The number of Redis shards to start in addition to
            the primary Redis shard.
        redis_max_clients: If provided, attempt to configure Redis with this
            maxclients number.
        redis_password (str): Prevents external clients without the password
            from connecting to Redis if provided.
        plasma_directory: A directory where the Plasma memory mapped files will
            be created.
        huge_pages: Boolean flag indicating whether to start the Object
            Store with hugetlbfs support. Requires plasma_directory.
        include_webui: Boolean flag indicating whether to start the web
            UI, which displays the status of the Ray cluster.
        job_id: The ID of this job.
        configure_logging: True if allow the logging cofiguration here.
            Otherwise, the users may want to configure it by their own.
        logging_level: Logging level, default will be logging.INFO.
        logging_format: Logging format, default contains a timestamp,
            filename, line number, and message. See ray_constants.py.
        plasma_store_socket_name (str): If provided, it will specify the socket
            name used by the plasma store.
        raylet_socket_name (str): If provided, it will specify the socket path
            used by the raylet process.
        temp_dir (str): If provided, it will specify the root temporary
            directory for the Ray process.
        load_code_from_local: Whether code should be loaded from a local module
            or from the GCS.
        _internal_config (str): JSON configuration for overriding
            RayConfig defaults. For testing purposes ONLY.

    Returns:
        Address information about the started processes.

    Raises:
        Exception: An exception is raised if an inappropriate combination of
            arguments is passed in.
