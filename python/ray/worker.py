    Connect to an existing Ray cluster or start one and connect to it.

    This method handles two cases; either a Ray cluster already exists and we
    just attach this driver to it or we start all of the processes associated
    with a Ray cluster and attach to the newly started cluster.

    To start Ray and all of the relevant processes, use this as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        ray.init()

    To connect to an existing Ray cluster, use this as follows (substituting
    in the appropriate address):

    .. code-block:: python

        ray.init(address="123.45.67.89:6379")

    You can also define an environment variable called `RAY_ADDRESS` in
    the same format as the `address` parameter to connect to an existing
    cluster with ray.init() or ray.init(address="auto").

    Args:
        address (str): The address of the Ray cluster to connect to. If
            this address is not provided, then this command will start Redis,
            a raylet, a plasma store, a plasma manager, and some workers.
            It will also kill these processes when Python exits. If the driver
            is running on a node in a Ray cluster, using `auto` as the value
            tells the driver to detect the the cluster, removing the need to
            specify a specific node address. If the environment variable
            `RAY_ADDRESS` is defined and the address is None or "auto", Ray
            will set `address` to `RAY_ADDRESS`.
        num_cpus (int): Number of CPUs the user wishes to assign to each
            raylet. By default, this is set based on virtual cores.
        num_gpus (int): Number of GPUs the user wishes to assign to each
            raylet. By default, this is set based on detected GPUs.
        resources: A dictionary mapping the names of custom resources to the
            quantities for them available.
        object_store_memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) to start the
            object store with. By default, this is automatically set based on
            available system memory.
        local_mode (bool): If true, the code will be executed serially. This
            is useful for debugging.
        ignore_reinit_error: If true, Ray suppresses errors from calling
            ray.init() a second time. Ray won't be restarted.
        include_dashboard: Boolean flag indicating whether or not to start the
            Ray dashboard, which displays the status of the Ray
            cluster. If this argument is None, then the UI will be started if
            the relevant dependencies are present.
        dashboard_host: The host to bind the dashboard server to. Can either be
            localhost (127.0.0.1) or 0.0.0.0 (available from all interfaces).
            By default, this is set to localhost to prevent access from
            external machines.
        dashboard_port(int, None): The port to bind the dashboard server to.
            Defaults to 8265 and Ray will automatically find a free port if
            8265 is not available.
        job_config (ray.job_config.JobConfig): The job configuration.
        configure_logging: True (default) if configuration of logging is
            allowed here. Otherwise, the user may want to configure it
            separately.
        logging_level: Logging level, defaults to logging.INFO. Ignored unless
            "configure_logging" is true.
        logging_format: Logging format, defaults to string containing a
            timestamp, filename, line number, and message. See the source file
            ray_constants.py for details. Ignored unless "configure_logging"
            is true.
        log_to_driver (bool): If true, the output from all of the worker
            processes on all nodes will be directed to the driver.
        _enable_object_reconstruction (bool): If True, when an object stored in
            the distributed plasma store is lost due to node failure, Ray will
            attempt to reconstruct the object by re-executing the task that
            created the object. Arguments to the task will be recursively
            reconstructed. If False, then ray.ObjectLostError will be
            thrown.
        _redis_max_memory: Redis max memory.
        _plasma_directory: Override the plasma mmap file directory.
        _node_ip_address (str): The IP address of the node that we are on.
        _driver_object_store_memory (int): Limit the amount of memory the
            driver can use in the object store for creating objects.
        _memory: Amount of reservable memory resource to create.
        _redis_password (str): Prevents external clients without the password
            from connecting to Redis if provided.
        _temp_dir (str): If provided, specifies the root temporary
            directory for the Ray process. Defaults to an OS-specific
            conventional location, e.g., "/tmp/ray".
        _metrics_export_port(int): Port number Ray exposes system metrics
            through a Prometheus endpoint. It is currently under active
            development, and the API is subject to change.
        _system_config (dict): Configuration for overriding
            RayConfig defaults. For testing purposes ONLY.
        _tracing_startup_hook (str): If provided, turns on and sets up tracing
        for Ray. Must be the name of a function that takes no arguments and
        sets up a Tracer Provider, Remote Span Processors, and
        (optional) additional instruments. See more at
        docs.ray.io/tracing.html. It is currently under active development,
        and the API is subject to change.

    Returns:
        Address information about the started processes.

    Raises:
        Exception: An exception is raised if an inappropriate combination of
            arguments is passed in.

    work and then shut down. If you want to kill them immediately, you can
    also call ``ray.kill(actor)``.

    Args:
        num_returns (int): This is only for *remote functions*. It specifies
            the number of object refs returned by
            the remote function invocation.
        num_cpus (float): The quantity of CPU cores to reserve
            for this task or for the lifetime of the actor.
        num_gpus (int): The quantity of GPUs to reserve
            for this task or for the lifetime of the actor.
        resources (Dict[str, float]): The quantity of various custom resources
            to reserve for this task or for the lifetime of the actor.
            This is a dictionary mapping strings (resource names) to floats.
        accelerator_type: If specified, requires that the task or actor run
            on a node with the specified type of accelerator.
            See `ray.accelerators` for accelerator types.
        max_calls (int): Only for *remote functions*. This specifies the
            maximum number of times that a given worker can execute
            the given remote function before it must exit
            (this can be used to address memory leaks in third-party
            libraries or to reclaim resources that cannot easily be
            released, e.g., GPU memory that was acquired by TensorFlow).
            By default this is infinite.
        max_restarts (int): Only for *actors*. This specifies the maximum
            number of times that the actor should be restarted when it dies
            unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0 (default),
            which indicates that the actor doesn't need to be restarted.
            A value of -1 indicates that an actor should be restarted
            indefinitely.
        max_task_retries (int): Only for *actors*. How many times to
            retry an actor task if the task fails due to a system error,
            e.g., the actor has died. If set to -1, the system will
            retry the failed task until the task succeeds, or the actor
            has reached its max_restarts limit. If set to `n > 0`, the
            system will retry the failed task up to n times, after which the
            task will throw a `RayActorError` exception upon :obj:`ray.get`.
            Note that Python exceptions are not considered system errors
            and will not trigger retries.
        max_retries (int): Only for *remote functions*. This specifies
            the maximum number of times that the remote function
            should be rerun when the worker process executing it
            crashes unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0,
            the default is 4 (default), and a value of -1 indicates
            infinite retries.
        runtime_env (Dict[str, Any]): Specifies the runtime environment for
            this actor or task and its children. See``runtime_env.py`` for
            detailed documentation.  Note: can only be set via `.options()`.
        override_environment_variables (Dict[str, str]): This specifies
            environment variables to override for the actor or task.  The
            overrides are propagated to all child actors and tasks.  This
            is a dictionary mapping variable names to their values.  Existing
            variables can be overridden, new ones can be created, and an
            existing variable can be unset by setting it to an empty string.
            Note: can only be set via `.options()`.
