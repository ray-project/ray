    """Connect to an existing Ray cluster or start one and connect to it.

    This method handles two cases. Either a Ray cluster already exists and we
    just attach this driver to it, or we start all of the processes associated
    with a Ray cluster and attach to the newly started cluster.

    To start Ray and all of the relevant processes, use this as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        ray.init()

    To connect to an existing Ray cluster, use this as follows (substituting
    in the appropriate address):

    .. code-block:: python

        ray.init(address="123.45.67.89:6379")

    Args:
        address (str): The address of the Ray cluster to connect to. If
            this address is not provided, then this command will start Redis, a
            raylet, a plasma store, a plasma manager, and some workers.
            It will also kill these processes when Python exits.
        redis_address (str): Deprecated; same as address.
        redis_port (int): The port that the primary Redis shard should listen
            to. If None, then a random port will be chosen.
        num_cpus (int): Number of cpus the user wishes all raylets to
            be configured with.
        num_gpus (int): Number of gpus the user wishes all raylets to
            be configured with.
        resources: A dictionary mapping the name of a resource to the quantity
            of that resource available.
        memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) that is available for use by
            workers requesting memory resources. By default, this is autoset
            based on available system memory.
        object_store_memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) to start the
            object store with. By default, this is autoset based on available
            system memory, subject to a 20GB cap.
        redis_max_memory: The max amount of memory (in bytes) to allow each
            redis shard to use. Once the limit is exceeded, redis will start
            LRU eviction of entries. This only applies to the sharded redis
            tables (task, object, and profile tables).  By default, this is
            autoset based on available system memory, subject to a 10GB cap.
        log_to_driver (bool): If true, then output from all of the worker
            processes on all nodes will be directed to the driver.
        node_ip_address (str): The IP address of the node that we are on.
        object_id_seed (int): Used to seed the deterministic generation of
            object IDs. The same value can be used across multiple runs of the
            same driver in order to generate the object IDs in a consistent
            manner. However, the same ID should not be used for different
            drivers.
        local_mode (bool): True if the code should be executed serially
            without Ray. This is useful for debugging.
        driver_object_store_memory (int): Limit the amount of memory the driver
            can use in the object store for creating objects. By default, this
            is autoset based on available system memory, subject to a 20GB cap.
        ignore_reinit_error: True if we should suppress errors from calling
            ray.init() a second time.
        num_redis_shards: The number of Redis shards to start in addition to
            the primary Redis shard.
        redis_max_clients: If provided, attempt to configure Redis with this
            maxclients number.
        redis_password (str): Prevents external clients without the password
            from connecting to Redis if provided.
        plasma_directory: A directory where the Plasma memory mapped files will
            be created.
        huge_pages: Boolean flag indicating whether to start the Object
            Store with hugetlbfs support. Requires plasma_directory.
        include_java: Boolean flag indicating whether to enable java worker.
        include_webui: Boolean flag indicating whether to start the web
            UI, which displays the status of the Ray cluster. If this argument
            is None, then the UI will be started if the relevant dependencies
            are present.
        webui_host: The host to bind the web UI server to. Can either be
            localhost (127.0.0.1) or 0.0.0.0 (available from all interfaces).
            By default, this is set to localhost to prevent access from
            external machines.
        job_id: The ID of this job.
        configure_logging: True if allow the logging cofiguration here.
            Otherwise, the users may want to configure it by their own.
        logging_level: Logging level, default will be logging.INFO.
        logging_format: Logging format, default contains a timestamp,
            filename, line number, and message. See ray_constants.py.
        plasma_store_socket_name (str): If provided, it will specify the socket
            name used by the plasma store.
        raylet_socket_name (str): If provided, it will specify the socket path
            used by the raylet process.
        temp_dir (str): If provided, it will specify the root temporary
            directory for the Ray process.
        load_code_from_local: Whether code should be loaded from a local module
            or from the GCS.
        use_pickle: Whether data objects should be serialized with cloudpickle.
        _internal_config (str): JSON configuration for overriding
            RayConfig defaults. For testing purposes ONLY.

    Returns:
        Address information about the started processes.

    Raises:
        Exception: An exception is raised if an inappropriate combination of
            arguments is passed in.

        def f():
            return 1

        @ray.remote
        class Foo:
            def method(self):
                return 1

    It can also be used with specific keyword arguments:

    * **num_return_vals:** This is only for *remote functions*. It specifies
      the number of object IDs returned by the remote function invocation.
    * **num_cpus:** The quantity of CPU cores to reserve for this task or for
      the lifetime of the actor.
    * **num_gpus:** The quantity of GPUs to reserve for this task or for the
      lifetime of the actor.
    * **resources:** The quantity of various custom resources to reserve for
      this task or for the lifetime of the actor. This is a dictionary mapping
      strings (resource names) to numbers.
    * **max_calls:** Only for *remote functions*. This specifies the maximum
      number of times that a given worker can execute the given remote function
      before it must exit (this can be used to address memory leaks in
      third-party libraries or to reclaim resources that cannot easily be
      released, e.g., GPU memory that was acquired by TensorFlow). By
      default this is infinite.
    * **max_reconstructions**: Only for *actors*. This specifies the maximum
      number of times that the actor should be reconstructed when it dies
      unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0 (default), which indicates
      that the actor doesn't need to be reconstructed. And the maximum valid
      value is ray.ray_constants.INFINITE_RECONSTRUCTION.
    * **max_retries**: Only for *remote functions*. This specifies the maximum
      number of times that the remote function should be rerun when the worker
      process executing it crashes unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0,
      the default is 4 (default), and the maximum valid value is
      ray.ray_constants.INFINITE_RECONSTRUCTION.

    This can be done as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        @ray.remote(num_gpus=1, max_calls=1, num_return_vals=2)
        def f():
            return 1, 2

        @ray.remote(num_cpus=2, resources={"CustomResource": 1})
        class Foo:
            def method(self):
                return 1

    Remote task and actor objects returned by @ray.remote can also be
    dynamically modified with the same arguments as above using
    ``.options()`` as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        @ray.remote(num_gpus=1, max_calls=1, num_return_vals=2)
        def f():
            return 1, 2

            def method(self):
                return 1
        Bar = Foo.options(num_cpus=1, resources=None)

    Running remote actors will be terminated when the actor handle to them
    in Python is deleted, which will cause them to complete any outstanding
    work and then shut down. If you want to kill them immediately, you can
    also call ``ray.kill(actor)``.
