        start_ray_local (bool): If True then this will start any processes not
            already in address_info, including Redis, a global scheduler, local
            scheduler(s), object store(s), and worker(s). It will also kill

            same job in order to generate the object IDs in a consistent
            manner. However, the same ID should not be used for different jobs.

            provided if start_ray_local is True.
        num_local_schedulers (int): The number of local schedulers to start.
            This is only provided if start_ray_local is True.
        object_store_memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) to start the
            object store with.
        driver_mode (bool): The mode in which to start the driver. This should
            be one of ray.SCRIPT_MODE, ray.PYTHON_MODE, and ray.SILENT_MODE.
        redirect_worker_output: True if the stdout and stderr of worker
            processes should be redirected to files.
        redirect_output (bool): True if stdout and stderr for non-worker
            processes should be redirected to files and false otherwise.
        start_workers_from_local_scheduler (bool): If this flag is True, then
            start the initial workers from the local scheduler. Else, start
            them from Python. The latter case is for debugging purposes only.
        num_cpus (int): Number of cpus the user wishes all local schedulers to
            be configured with.
        num_gpus (int): Number of gpus the user wishes all local schedulers to
            be configured with. If unspecified, Ray will attempt to autodetect
            the number of GPUs available on the node (note that autodetection
            currently only works for Nvidia GPUs).
        resources: A dictionary mapping resource names to the quantity of that
            resource available.
        num_redis_shards: The number of Redis shards to start in addition to
            the primary Redis shard.
        redis_max_clients: If provided, attempt to configure Redis with this
            maxclients number.
        plasma_directory: A directory where the Plasma memory mapped files will
            be created.
        huge_pages: Boolean flag indicating whether to start the Object
            Store with hugetlbfs support. Requires plasma_directory.
        include_webui: Boolean flag indicating whether to start the web
            UI, which is a Jupyter notebook.
        use_raylet: True if the new raylet code path should be used. This is
            not supported yet.

        Address information about the started processes.
