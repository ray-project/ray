    Calls a standard 'check_call' if process_runner is not subprocess.

    Specifically, run all command output through regex to detect
    error conditions and filter out non-error messages that went to stderr
    anyway (SSH writes ALL of its "system" messages to stderr even if they
    are not actually errors).

    Args:
        cmd (List[str]): Command to run.
        process_runner: Used for command execution. Assumed to have
            'check_call' and 'check_output' inplemented.
        stdout_file: File to redirect stdout to.
        stderr_file: File to redirect stderr to.

    Implementation notes:
    1. `use_login_shells` disables special processing
    If we run interactive apps, output processing will likely get
    overwhelmed with the interactive output elements.
    Thus, we disable output processing for login shells. This makes
    the logging experience considerably worse, but it only degrades
    to old-style logging.

    For example, `pip install` outputs HUNDREDS of progress-bar lines
    when downloading a package, and we have to
    read + regex + write all of them.

    After all, even just printing output to console can often slow
    down a fast-printing app, and we do more than just print, and
    all that from Python, which is much slower than C regarding
    stream processing.

    2. `stdin=PIPE` for subprocesses
    Do not inherit stdin as it messes with bash signals
    (ctrl-C for SIGINT) and these commands aren't supposed to
    take input anyway.

    3. `ThreadPoolExecutor` without the `Pool`
    We use `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create futures from threads.
    Threads are never reused.

    This approach allows us to have no custom synchronization by
    off-loading the return value and exception passing to the
    standard library (`ThreadPoolExecutor` internals).

    This instance will be `shutdown()` ASAP so it's fine to
    create one in such a weird place.

    The code is thus 100% thread-safe as long as the stream readers
    are read-only except for return values and possible exceptions.
