# If required, head and worker nodes can exist on subnets in different VPCs and
# communicate via VPC peering.

# VPC peering overview: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-peering.html.
# Setup VPC peering: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html.
# Configure VPC peering route tables: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-routing.html.

# To enable external SSH connectivity, you should also ensure that your VPC
# is configured to assign public IPv4 addresses to every EC2 instance
# assigned to it.
