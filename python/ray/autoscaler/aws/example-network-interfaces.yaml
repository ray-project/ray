    # Ensure that all Security Group IDs associated with your network interfaces
    # below are available in this region. If you are using Elastic Fabric
    # Adaptors (EFA) with your network interfaces, then ensure that the
    # available instance types in this region support EFA. To see the available
    # instance types that support EFA in a Region, use the

    # appropriate Region code:

    # Note that availability zones can be omitted when using custom network
    # interfaces with all node types, since each node will always be launched in
    # the availability zone shared by its network interface subnets.
    # If some of your node types have network interfaces configured and others
    # do not, then node types without network interfaces will be limited to
    # launching only in subnets available in the given availability zones.

    # The example network interfaces below don't associate public IP addresses
    # with Ray cluster nodes, so we need to explicitly tell Ray to connect to
    # them via their private IP addresses. This also means that any instance
    # running "ray up" or otherwise communicating with cluster nodes must be
    # located in the same VPC to succeed. This line should be omitted if your
    # network interfaces use public IP addresses.
