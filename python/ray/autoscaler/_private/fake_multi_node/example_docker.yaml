# This is an example config file to start a local
# multi-node cluster using Docker compose.
# It requires the ``docker compose`` plugin to be installed:
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#installing-compose-v2
# The resulting cluster will consist of docker containers
# scheduled via docker compose. These containers behave just like
# regular Ray nodes, have their own IPs, and can SSH into each other.
# They are mostly used to test multi-node setups and autoscaling on
# a single node.

# Example command to start a cluster with this config:
#
# python docker_monitor.py example_docker.yaml &
# RAY_FAKE_DOCKER=1 ray up -y example_docker.yaml
