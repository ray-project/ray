    Connect to an existing Ray cluster or start one and connect to it.

    This method handles two cases; either a Ray cluster already exists and we
    just attach this driver to it or we start all of the processes associated
    with a Ray cluster and attach to the newly started cluster.
    Note: This method overwrite sigterm handler of the driver process.

    In most cases, it is enough to just call this method with no arguments.
    This will autodetect an existing Ray cluster or start a new Ray instance if
    no existing cluster is found:

    .. testcode::

        ray.init()

    To explicitly connect to an existing local cluster, use this as follows. A
    ConnectionError will be thrown if no existing local cluster is found.

    .. testcode::
        :skipif: True

        ray.init(address="auto")

    To connect to an existing remote cluster, use this as follows (substituting
    in the appropriate address). Note the addition of "ray://" at the beginning
    of the address. This requires `ray[client]`.

    .. testcode::
        :skipif: True

        ray.init(address="ray://123.45.67.89:10001")

    More details for starting and connecting to a remote cluster can be found
    here: https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/getting-started.html

    You can also define an environment variable called `RAY_ADDRESS` in
    the same format as the `address` parameter to connect to an existing
    cluster with ray.init() or ray.init(address="auto").

    Args:
        address: The address of the Ray cluster to connect to. The provided
            address is resolved as follows:
            1. If a concrete address (e.g., localhost:<port>) is provided, try to
            connect to it. Concrete addresses can be prefixed with "ray://" to
            connect to a remote cluster. For example, passing in the address
            "ray://123.45.67.89:50005" will connect to the cluster at the given
            address.
            2. If no address is provided, try to find an existing Ray instance
            to connect to. This is done by first checking the environment
            variable `RAY_ADDRESS`. If this is not defined, check the address
            of the latest cluster started (found in
            /tmp/ray/ray_current_cluster) if available. If this is also empty,
            then start a new local Ray instance.
            3. If the provided address is "auto", then follow the same process
            as above. However, if there is no existing cluster found, this will
            throw a ConnectionError instead of starting a new local Ray
            instance.
            4. If the provided address is "local", start a new local Ray
            instance, even if there is already an existing local Ray instance.
        num_cpus: Number of CPUs the user wishes to assign to each
            raylet. By default, this is set based on virtual cores.
        num_gpus: Number of GPUs the user wishes to assign to each
            raylet. By default, this is set based on detected GPUs.
        resources: A dictionary mapping the names of custom resources to the
            quantities for them available.
        labels: [Experimental] The key-value labels of the node.
        object_store_memory: The amount of memory (in bytes) to start the
            object store with. By default, this is automatically set based on
            available system memory.
        local_mode: Deprecated: consider using the Ray Debugger instead.
        ignore_reinit_error: If true, Ray suppresses errors from calling
            ray.init() a second time. Ray won't be restarted.
        include_dashboard: Boolean flag indicating whether or not to start the
            Ray dashboard, which displays the status of the Ray
            cluster. If this argument is None, then the UI will be started if
            the relevant dependencies are present.
        dashboard_host: The host to bind the dashboard server to. Can either be
            localhost (127.0.0.1) or 0.0.0.0 (available from all interfaces).
            By default, this is set to localhost to prevent access from
            external machines.
        dashboard_port(int, None): The port to bind the dashboard server to.
            Defaults to 8265 and Ray will automatically find a free port if
            8265 is not available.
        job_config (ray.job_config.JobConfig): The job configuration.
        configure_logging: True (default) if configuration of logging is
            allowed here. Otherwise, the user may want to configure it
            separately.
        logging_level: Logging level, defaults to logging.INFO. Ignored unless
            "configure_logging" is true.
        logging_format: Logging format, defaults to string containing a
            timestamp, filename, line number, and message. See the source file
            ray_constants.py for details. Ignored unless "configure_logging"
            is true.
        log_to_driver: If true, the output from all of the worker
            processes on all nodes will be directed to the driver.
        namespace: A namespace is a logical grouping of jobs and named actors.
        runtime_env: The runtime environment to use
            for this job (see :ref:`runtime-environments` for details).
        storage: [Experimental] Specify a URI for persistent cluster-wide storage.
            This storage path must be accessible by all nodes of the cluster, otherwise
            an error will be raised. This option can also be specified as the
            RAY_STORAGE env var.
        _enable_object_reconstruction: If True, when an object stored in
            the distributed plasma store is lost due to node failure, Ray will
            attempt to reconstruct the object by re-executing the task that
            created the object. Arguments to the task will be recursively
            reconstructed. If False, then ray.ObjectLostError will be
            thrown.
        _redis_max_memory: Redis max memory.
        _plasma_directory: Override the plasma mmap file directory.
        _node_ip_address: The IP address of the node that we are on.
        _driver_object_store_memory: Deprecated.
        _memory: Amount of reservable memory resource in bytes rounded
            down to the nearest integer.
        _redis_password: Prevents external clients without the password
            from connecting to Redis if provided.
        _temp_dir: If provided, specifies the root temporary
            directory for the Ray process. Must be an absolute path. Defaults to an
            OS-specific conventional location, e.g., "/tmp/ray".
        _metrics_export_port: Port number Ray exposes system metrics
            through a Prometheus endpoint. It is currently under active
            development, and the API is subject to change.
        _system_config: Configuration for overriding
            RayConfig defaults. For testing purposes ONLY.
        _tracing_startup_hook: If provided, turns on and sets up tracing
            for Ray. Must be the name of a function that takes no arguments and
            sets up a Tracer Provider, Remote Span Processors, and
            (optional) additional instruments. See more at
            docs.ray.io/tracing.html. It is currently under active development,
            and the API is subject to change.
        _node_name: User-provided node name or identifier. Defaults to
            the node IP address.

    Returns:
        If the provided address includes a protocol, for example by prepending
        "ray://" to the address to get "ray://1.2.3.4:10001", then a
        ClientContext is returned with information such as settings, server
        versions for ray and python, and the dashboard_url. Otherwise,
        a RayContext is returned with ray and python versions, and address
        information about the started processes.

    Raises:
        Exception: An exception is raised if an inappropriate combination of
            arguments is passed in.

    object has been created). If object_refs is a list, then the objects
    corresponding to each object in the list will be returned.

    Ordering for an input list of object refs is preserved for each object
    returned. That is, if an object ref to A precedes an object ref to B in the
    input list, then A will precede B in the returned list.

    This method will issue a warning if it's running inside async context,

    a list of object refs, you can use ``await asyncio.gather(*object_refs)``.

    Task:
        If the specified Task is pending execution, it is cancelled and not
        executed. If the Task is currently executing, the behavior depends
        on the `force` flag. When `force=False`, a KeyboardInterrupt is
        raised in Python and when `force=True`, the executing Task
        immediately exits. If the Task is already finished, nothing happens.

        Cancelled Tasks aren't retried. `max_task_retries` aren't respected.

        Calling ray.get on a cancelled Task raises a TaskCancelledError
        if the Task has been scheduled or interrupted.
        It raises a WorkerCrashedError if `force=True`.

        If `recursive=True`, all the child Tasks and Actor Tasks
        are cancelled. If `force=True` and `recursive=True`, `force=True`
        is ignored for child Actor Tasks.

    Actor Task:
        If the specified Task is pending execution, it is cancelled and not
        executed. If the Task is currently executing, the behavior depends
        on the execution model of an Actor. If it is a regular Actor
        or a threaded Actor, the execution isn't cancelled.
        Actor Tasks cannot be interrupted because Actors have
        states. If it is an async Actor, Ray cancels a `asyncio.Task`.
        The semantic of cancellation is equivalent to asyncio's cancellation.
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-cancellation
        If the Task has finished, nothing happens.

    """Defines a remote function or an actor class.

    This function can be used as a decorator with no arguments
    to define a remote function or actor as follows:

    .. testcode::

        import ray

        @ray.remote
        def f(a, b, c):
            return a + b + c

        object_ref = f.remote(1, 2, 3)
        result = ray.get(object_ref)
        assert result == (1 + 2 + 3)

        @ray.remote
        class Foo:
            def __init__(self, arg):
                self.x = arg

            def method(self, a):
                return self.x + a

        actor_handle = Foo.remote(123)
        object_ref = actor_handle.method.remote(321)
        result = ray.get(object_ref)
        assert result == (123 + 321)

    Equivalently, use a function call to create a remote function or actor.

    .. testcode::

        def g(a, b, c):
            return a + b + c

        remote_g = ray.remote(g)
        object_ref = remote_g.remote(1, 2, 3)
        assert ray.get(object_ref) == (1 + 2 + 3)

        class Bar:
            def __init__(self, arg):
                self.x = arg

            def method(self, a):
                return self.x + a

        RemoteBar = ray.remote(Bar)
        actor_handle = RemoteBar.remote(123)
        object_ref = actor_handle.method.remote(321)
        result = ray.get(object_ref)
        assert result == (123 + 321)


    It can also be used with specific keyword arguments as follows:

    .. testcode::

        @ray.remote(num_gpus=1, max_calls=1, num_returns=2)
        def f():
            return 1, 2

        @ray.remote(num_cpus=2, resources={"CustomResource": 1})
        class Foo:
            def method(self):
                return 1

    Remote task and actor objects returned by @ray.remote can also be
    dynamically modified with the same arguments as above using
    ``.options()`` as follows:

    .. testcode::
        :hide:

        ray.shutdown()

        ray.init(num_cpus=5, num_gpus=5)

    .. testcode::

        @ray.remote(num_gpus=1, max_calls=1, num_returns=2)
        def f():
            return 1, 2

        f_with_2_gpus = f.options(num_gpus=2)
        object_refs = f_with_2_gpus.remote()
        assert ray.get(object_refs) == [1, 2]

        @ray.remote(num_cpus=2, resources={"CustomResource": 1})
        class Foo:
            def method(self):
                return 1

        Foo_with_no_resources = Foo.options(num_cpus=1, resources=None)
        foo_actor = Foo_with_no_resources.remote()
        assert ray.get(foo_actor.method.remote()) == 1


    A remote actor will be terminated when all actor handle to it
    in Python is deleted, which will cause them to complete any outstanding
    work and then shut down. If you only have 1 reference to an actor handle,
    calling ``del actor`` *could* trigger actor deletion. Note that your program
    may have multiple references to the same ActorHandle, and actor termination
    will not occur until the reference count goes to 0. See the Python
    documentation for more context about object deletion.
    https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__

    If you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call ``ray.kill(actor)``.

    .. tip::
        Avoid repeatedly passing in large arguments to remote task or method calls.

        Instead, use ray.put to create a copy of the object in the object store.

        See :ref:`more info here <ray-pass-large-arg-by-value>`.

    Args:
        num_returns: This is only for *remote functions*. It specifies
            the number of object refs returned by the remote function
            invocation. The default value is 1.
            Pass "dynamic" to allow the task to decide how many
            return values to return during execution, and the caller will
            receive an ObjectRef[ObjectRefGenerator].
            See :ref:`dynamic generators <dynamic-generators>` for more details.
        num_cpus: The quantity of CPU resources to reserve
            for this task or for the lifetime of the actor.
            By default, tasks use 1 CPU resource and actors use 1 CPU
            for scheduling and 0 CPU for running
            (This means, by default, actors cannot get scheduled on a zero-cpu node,
            but an infinite number of them can run on any non-zero cpu node.
            The default value for actors was chosen for historical reasons.
            It’s recommended to always explicitly set num_cpus for actors
            to avoid any surprises.
            If resources are specified explicitly,
            they are required for both scheduling and running.)
            See :ref:`specifying resource requirements <resource-requirements>`
            for more details.
        num_gpus: The quantity of GPU resources to reserve
            for this task or for the lifetime of the actor.
            The default value is 0.
            See :ref:`Ray GPU support <gpu-support>` for more details.
        resources (Dict[str, float]): The quantity of various
            :ref:`custom resources <custom-resources>`
            to reserve for this task or for the lifetime of the actor.
            This is a dictionary mapping strings (resource names) to floats.
            By default it is empty.
        accelerator_type: If specified, requires that the task or actor run
            on a node with the specified type of accelerator.
            See `ray.util.accelerators` for accelerator types.
        memory: The heap memory request in bytes for this task/actor,
            rounded down to the nearest integer.
        max_calls: Only for *remote functions*. This specifies the
            maximum number of times that a given worker can execute
            the given remote function before it must exit
            (this can be used to address :ref:`memory leaks <gpu-leak>` in third-party
            libraries or to reclaim resources that cannot easily be
            released, e.g., GPU memory that was acquired by TensorFlow).
            By default this is infinite for CPU tasks and 1 for GPU tasks
            (to force GPU tasks to release resources after finishing).
        max_restarts: Only for *actors*. This specifies the maximum
            number of times that the actor should be restarted when it dies
            unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0 (default),
            which indicates that the actor doesn't need to be restarted.
            A value of -1 indicates that an actor should be restarted
            indefinitely.
            See :ref:`actor fault tolerance <fault-tolerance-actors>` for more details.
        max_task_retries: Only for *actors*. How many times to
            retry an actor task if the task fails due to a system error,
            e.g., the actor has died. If set to -1, the system will
            retry the failed task until the task succeeds, or the actor
            has reached its max_restarts limit. If set to `n > 0`, the
            system will retry the failed task up to n times, after which the
            task will throw a `RayActorError` exception upon :obj:`ray.get`.
            Note that Python exceptions are not considered system errors
            and will not trigger retries.
            The default value is 0.
            See :ref:`actor fault tolerance <fault-tolerance-actors>` for more details.
        max_retries: Only for *remote functions*. This specifies
            the maximum number of times that the remote function
            should be rerun when the worker process executing it
            crashes unexpectedly. The minimum valid value is 0,
            the default value is 3, and a value of -1 indicates
            infinite retries.
            See :ref:`task fault tolerance <fault-tolerance-tasks>` for more details.
        runtime_env (Dict[str, Any]): Specifies the runtime environment for
            this actor or task and its children. See
            :ref:`runtime-environments` for detailed documentation.
        retry_exceptions: Only for *remote functions*. This specifies whether
            application-level errors should be retried up to max_retries times.
            This can be a boolean or a list of exceptions that should be retried.
            See :ref:`task fault tolerance <fault-tolerance-tasks>` for more details.
        scheduling_strategy: Strategy about how to
            schedule a remote function or actor. Possible values are
            None: ray will figure out the scheduling strategy to use, it
            will either be the PlacementGroupSchedulingStrategy using parent's
            placement group if parent has one and has
            placement_group_capture_child_tasks set to true,
            or "DEFAULT";
            "DEFAULT": default hybrid scheduling;
            "SPREAD": best effort spread scheduling;
            `PlacementGroupSchedulingStrategy`:
            placement group based scheduling;
            `NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy`:
            node id based affinity scheduling.
            See :ref:`Ray scheduling strategies <ray-scheduling-strategies>`
            for more details.
        _metadata: Extended options for Ray libraries. For example,
            _metadata={"workflows.io/options": <workflow options>} for Ray workflows.
