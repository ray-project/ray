class ResourceManager(abc.ABC):
    """Resource manager interface.

    A resource manager can be used to request resources from a Ray cluster and
    allocate them to remote Ray tasks.

    Because Ray clusters can autoscale, we need to request resources before
    we can allocate them. Effectively this means we have to keep track
    of requested resources (which can trigger autoscaling). Once the requested
    resources are available to be scheduled, the control loop can acquire them.

    This separation also ensures that requests can be cancelled before they resolve
    if resources are not needed anymore.

    Thus, resources managed by the resource manager have three states:

    1. Requested but not available (ready). The resource request is received,
       but the resources are not available for use of remote Ray objects, yet.
    2. Requested and ready. The resources can be acquired and subsequently used by
       remote Ray objects.
    3. Acquired. These resources have been acquired by a caller.

    The flow is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Create resource manager
        resource_manager = ResourceManager()

        # Create resource request
        resource_request = ResourceRequest([{"CPU": 4}])

        # Pass to resource manager
        resource_manager.request_resources(resource_request)

        # Wait until ready
        while not resource_manager.has_resources_ready(resource_request):
            time.sleep(1)

        # Once ready, acquire resources
        acquired_resource = resource_manager.acquire_resources(resource_request)

        # Bind to remote task or actor
        annotated_remote_fn = acquired_resource.annotate_remote_objects(
            [remote_fn])

        # Run remote function. This will use the acquired resources
        ray.get(annotated_remote_fn.remote())

        # After using the resources, free
        resource_manager.free_resources(annotated_resources)
