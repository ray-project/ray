class ActorManager:
    """Management class for actors and actor task futures.

    This class provides an event-based management interface for actors and
    actor task futures.

    The actor manager can be used to start actors, stop actors, and schedule and
    track task futures on these actors. The manager will then yield events related
    to the tracked entities.

    For instance, when an actor is added with ``add_actor()``, the event
    ``ActorStarted`` will be emitted once the actor was successfully started.
    Likewise, after calling ``remove_actor()``, the event ``ActorStopped`` will
    be emitted once the actor stopped.
    If the actor fails at any time, the ``ActorFailed`` event will be emitted.

    For actor task futures, a subclass of the ``FutureResult`` event will be emitted
    when the future resolves. This is either a custom subclass provided when
    scheduling the future, or a ``FutureFailed`` event if resolving the future lead
    to a ``RayTaskError``.

    Actor properties are defined via an ``ActorSpec`` object. This object specifies
    the actor class, the keyword arguments used for initialization, and the resources
    required to start the actor.

    Once added, subsequent interaction with the actor via the manager uses an
    ``ActorInfo`` object. This object can be used to remove the actor or to schedule
    futures on it. It contains the original actor specification and an internal
    actor ID (unrelated to the Ray actor ID).

    Args:
        resource_manager: Resource manager used to request resources for the actors.
