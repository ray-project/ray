class RayActorManager:
    """Management class for Ray actors, tasks, and actor tasks.

    This class provides an event-based management interface for actors, tasks, and
    actor tasks.

    The manager can be used to start actors, stop actors, and schedule and
    track task futures individually or on these actors.
    The manager will then invoke callbacks related to the tracked entities.

    For instance, when an actor is added with
    :meth:`add_actor() <RayActorManager.add_actor>`,
    a :ref:`TrackedActor <ray.air.execution._internal.tracked_actor.TrackedActor`
    object is returned.
    The :meth:`TrackedActor.on_start()
    <ray.air.execution._internal.tracked_actor.TrackedActor.on_start>`
    method can then be used to specify a callback that is invoked once the actor
    successfully started. The other callbacks relating to tracked actors
    :meth:`TrackedActor.on_stop()
    <ray.air.execution._internal.tracked_actor.TrackedActor.on_stop>` and
    :meth:`TrackedActor.on_error()
    <ray.air.execution._internal.tracked_actor.TrackedActor.on_error>`

    Similarly, when scheduling an actor task using
    :meth:`schedule_actor_task()
    <ray.air.execution._internal.actor_manager.RayActorManager.schedule_actor_task>`,
    a :ref:`TrackedActorTask <TrackedActorTask>`
    object is returned.
    The :meth:`TrackedActorTask.on_result()
    <ray.air.execution._internal.tracked_actor_task.TrackedActorTask.on_result>`
    method can then be used to specify a callback that is invoked when the task
    successfully resolved.
    The :meth:`TrackedActorTask.on_error()
    <ray.air.execution._internal.tracked_actor_task.TrackedActorTask.on_error>`
    method can then be used to specify a callback that is invoked when the task
    fails.

    The RayActorManager does not implement any true asynchronous processing. Control
    has to be explicitly yielded to the event manager via :meth:`RayActorManager.wait`.
    Callbacks will only be invoked when control is with the RayActorManager, and
    callbacks will always be executed sequentially in order of arriving events.

    Args:
        resource_manager: Resource manager used to request resources for the actors.

        Calling this method will wait for up to ``timeout`` seconds for up to
        ``num_events`` new events to arrive.
        When events arrive, callbacks relating to the events will be
        invoked. A timeout of ``None`` will block until the next event arrives.

        If ``num_events`` is set, it will only wait for that many events to arrive
        before returning control to the caller. If ``num_events=None``, this will
        block until all tracked tasks resolved.

        ``event_type`` specifies the event types to await. If this includes
        Ray Actor events (i.e. ``EventType.ACTORS`` or ``EventType.ALL``), a
        timeout must be specified. This is to ensure that we don't run into a
        deadlock if not enough resources are available to start ``num_events``

        Note:
            If an actor task fails with a ``RayActorError``, this is one event,
            but it may trigger _two_ `on_error` callbacks: One for the actor,
            and one for the task.

        Note:
            The ``timeout`` argument is used for pure waiting time for events. It does
            not include time spent on processing callbacks. Depending on the processing
            time of the callbacks, it can take much longer for this function to
