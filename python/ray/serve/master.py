    """Responsible for managing the state of the serving system.

    The master actor implements fault tolerance by persisting its state in
    a new checkpoint each time a state change is made. If the actor crashes,
    the latest checkpoint is loaded and the state is recovered. Checkpoints
    are written/read using a provided KV-store interface.

    All hard state in the system is maintained by this actor and persisted via
    these checkpoints. Soft state required by other components is fetched by
    those actors from this actor on startup and updates are pushed out from
    this actor.

    All other actors started by the master actor are named, detached actors
    so they will not fate share with the master if it crashes.

    The following guarantees are provided for state-changing calls to the
    master actor:
        - If the call succeeds, the change was made and will be reflected in
          the system even if the master actor or other actors die unexpectedly.
        - If the call fails, the change may have been made but isn't guaranteed
          to have been. The client should retry in this case. Note that this
          requires all implementations here to be idempotent.
