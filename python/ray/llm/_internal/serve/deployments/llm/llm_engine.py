        To implement this method, you need to take a openAI compatible chat request, internally cast it to the target engine request type, and then call the engine's chat method.

        This method is an async generator, so it yields chunks of response and when it is done, it returns None. We have the following convention:

        - In case of streaming, yield a string representing data: <json_str>\n\n for each chunk. This should be already openAI compatible, so the higher level can just yield it to the client.
        - In case of non-streaming, yield a single object of type ChatCompletionResponse.
        - In case of error, yield a single object of type ErrorResponse.

        Args:
            request: The chat completion request.

        Yields:
            Union[str, ChatCompletionResponse, ErrorResponse]: A string representing a chunk of the response, a ChatCompletionResponse object, or an ErrorResponse object.

        Returns:
