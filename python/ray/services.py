  """Start Ray in local mode.

  Args:
    address_info (dict): A dictionary with address information for processes
      that have already been started. If provided, address_info will be
      modified to include processes that are newly started.
    node_ip_address (str): The IP address of this node.
    num_workers (int): The number of workers to start.
    num_local_schedulers (int): The total number of local schedulers required.
      This is also the total number of object stores required. This method will
      start new instances of local schedulers and object stores until there are
      at least num_local_schedulers existing instances of each, including ones
      already registered with the given address_info.
    worker_path (str): The path of the source code that will be run by the
      worker.
    cleanup (bool): If cleanup is true, then the processes started here will be
      killed by services.cleanup() when the Python process that called this
      method exits.
    redirect_output (bool): True if stdout and stderr should be redirected to
      /dev/null.

  Returns:
    A dictionary of the address information for the processes that were
      started.
