# uvloop is excluded from the serve depset because uvloop's Cython event loop
# does not expose _default_executor as a Python-accessible attribute, which
# breaks tests that inspect the asyncio event loop internals. Ray gracefully
# falls back to the standard asyncio event loop when uvloop is not installed.
