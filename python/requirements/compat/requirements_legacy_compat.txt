# ATTENTION: THESE DEPENDENCIES SHOULD USUALLY NOT BE UPDATED!

# Updating these dependencies means we remove official support for dependency releases older than
# the specified version.

# These are compatibility requirements to make sure certain workflows continue to work
# with these dependency versions. They thus act as a lower bound for compatibility
# with ML libraries.
# Concretely, we set up a fresh Python 3.7 environment and
# run the pipeline job in `Ray Python legacy dependency ML compatibility tests` with these dependencies installed.
